<P><A NAME="Definition"></A><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Definition</B>:</FONT>
<BR>The Coverage element describes the spatial and temporal characteristics
of the object or resource and is the key element for supporting spatial
or temporal range searching on document-like objects that are spatially
referenced or time-referenced. Coverage may be modified by the "type" qualifiers
"spatial" and "temporal".

<P>A resource may have both spatial and temporal coverages, or just one
of the two, or none. This element may be used in describing resources from
many different fields, e.g., archaeology, art, cartography, geography,
geographic information systems, medicine, natural sciences, etc. - any
field that deals with georeferenced information, spatial data, or time-referenced
data. Thus for example, resources describing the Grand Canyon of the United
States include text, maps, music (e.g., Ferde Grofe's Grand Canyon Suite),
statistics (e.g., number of visitors per year), works of art (such as the
panoramas that appear in the 1882 publication, "Atlas to accompany the
monograph on the Tertiary history of the Grand Canon district"), etc.;
and each could use Coverage - Spatial and in some cases Coverage - Temporal.

<P>Spatial information may be given in numeric form (e.g., degrees) or
in text. Temporal information may also be given in numeric form or in text.
Numbers are preferred. If scheme is not given, none is used. No defaults
are assumed.

<P><A NAME="Qualifiers"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Use of Qualifiers:</FONT></B>

<P>The Coverage element can be defined initially as:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>coverage.periodName
<LI>coverage.placeName
<LI>coverage.x
<LI>coverage.y
<LI>coverage.z
<LI>coverage.t
<LI>coverage.polygon
<LI>coverage.line</LI></UL>


<P>where the placeName and periodName are qualifiers for textual representation,
and the remainder are for coordinate-based classification. The coordinates
used are qualified by the scheme modifier to support different coordinate
systems (see below).

<P>The coverage.x, .y, .z, .t options handle the dimensionality of spatial
and temporal extent, and - if they are not further qualified - represent
a point in space or time or both. The polygon and line modifiers are required
where a complex 2-dimensional extent is required -- the polygon in the
case of areal extent or "footprint," and the line in the case of a flight
path associated with a suite or aerial photographs, for example. Inheritance
may be extended such that the x,y,z,t&nbsp; qualifiers reference beginning
and ending points in space and time to "bound" a coverage:
<UL>
<LI>coverage.x.min
<LI>coverage.x.max
<LI>coverage.y.min
<LI>coverage.y.max
<LI>coverage.t.min
<LI>coverage.t.max</LI></UL>


<P>With these six properties, a document can be classified as to its rough 
geographic extent with a beginning and ending time of coverage.

<P>To accommodate both spatial and temporal discontinuities, and as per
Dublin-Core general policy that all fields are repeatable and option, all
these elements may be repeated. It is conceivable that some data sets may
cover multiple, non-contiguous geographic footprints (e.g., the U.S. Exclusive
Economic Zone including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa).

<P>Therefore for x, y, z, and t, a numeric grouping subelement is added
at the end to keep the correct x with the correct y:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><LI>coverage.x.min.1
<LI>coverage.x.max.1
<LI>coverage.y.min.1
<LI>coverage.y.max.1
<LI>coverage.x.min.2
<LI>coverage.x.max.2
<LI>coverage.y.min.2
<LI>coverage.y.max.2</LI></UL>


<P>where groupings 1 and 2 describe two distinct bounding rectangles of
coverage that may be discontinuous. The time dimension is handled in the
same way. Spatially, footprints can also exhibit what is known as the "swiss
cheese" effect, where there is general overall coverage but there are islands
where there are no data. These exclusion and inclusion regions should be
accounted for in the semantics and syntax. The use of the polygon inclusion
and exclusion regions is given as:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><LI>coverage.polygon.include
<LI>coverage.polygon.exclude</LI></UL>


<P>where the values of this qualifier are stored as a single, closed chain
of x and y pairs. These inclusion and exclusion regions can be linked with
multiple exclusions associated with a given inclusion area, if needed,
using the .number syntax referenced above.

<P><A NAME="Schemes"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Use of Schemes:</FONT></B>

<P>This Coverage proposal includes the possibility for the use of multiple
classification schemes to further qualify the incoming information. Latitude
and longitude must occur in pairs; the schema used must be able to deal
with points, lines, and polygons - bounding rectangles and points being
the most frequently used. The use of an explicit scheme is encouraged,
as there are a large number of "native" coordinate representations that
may be easy to encode but difficult for the classifier to translate.

<P>Other planetary bodies, medical data, etc., may be differentiated by
specifying a schema. For imaginary places, no schema or latitude/longitude
will be given.

<P>Apart from specifying how the data is expressed (e.g., "DMS" for degrees-minutes-seconds;
"DD" for decimal degrees; "text" for text), the geodetic datum (e.g., WGS84,
NAD83, NAD27 CONUS, etc.) should be given when it is known. Examples follow:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><LI>&lt;meta name="DC.coverage.x" scheme="NAD27.DDM" content="-91.89"&gt
<LI>&lt;meta name="DC.coverage.z" scheme="WGS84.DDM" content="47"&gt
<LI>&lt;meta name="DC.coverage.y" scheme="UTM10" content="5454818"&gt
<LI>&lt;meta name="DC.coverage.x" scheme="UTM10" content="483282"&gt 
<BR>(DDM = Decimal degrees, metres)</LI></UL>


<P>Spatial schemes should include, but not be limited to:

<P>1. numeric: examples follow

<P>DMS: Degrees-Minutes-Seconds, in DDD-MM-SSX format, where D=Degrees,
M=Minutes, S=Seconds, and X=N or S for North or South latitude, respectively,
and E or W for East or West longitude.

<P>DD: Decimal-Degrees, in DD.XXXX format, where D=Degrees and the XXXX
represent decimal portions of a degree. This is preceded by a minus sign
(-) if the latitude is S or the longitude is W.

<P>Self-documenting data strings should be used whenever possible. Examples
follow:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><LI>49d4.5N 123d6.45W 45m
<LI>49d44'32"N 123d06'21W 120ft
<LI>49 44 32 N 123 06 21 W 45 m
</LI></UL>
OSGB -- Ordnance Survey Grid Base -- a local planimentric (x,y) system
used in Great Britain with units of measure being metres
<BR>
<BR>
UTMXX -- Universal Transverse Mercator where the scheme qualifier XX
represents the appropriate UTM zone of measure, with units in metres.
