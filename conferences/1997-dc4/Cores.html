other than English</H2><BR>

<P>
The Dublin Core is a set of fifteen basic categories (such as creator,
title, subject, and publisher) for describing information resources (see
<A HREF=http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core>http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core</A>).  When embedded in documents on
the World-Wide Web, these Core descriptions can be extracted by global
indexing services for use like a sort of library catalog.  Some first
adopters of the Dublin Core appreciate the generic simplicity of these
fifteen basic categories and use them "as is" -- let's call them the
"minimalists".  Others -- let's call them the "specialists" -- use
qualifiers to narrow the semantics of Core categories for specialized uses
-- for example, to specify that a particular "creator" is a "composer"
as opposed to an "author" or "photographer".  The success of the Dublin
Core as a standard will depend on its ability to satisfy the specialists'
need for this kind of specificity without compromising the semantic
integrity of the fifteen broad categories expected by the minimalists.

<P>
Until now, the Dublin Core has been defined and implemented only in
English.  Yet the meanings of these fifteen basic categories in their
"minimalist" sense could just as well be explained in French, German,
Japanese, or Thai.  The Dublin Core could become that which has long
eluded internationalist-minded librarians: a simple description model
consistent across many languages and scientific disciplines.

<P>
But if the Dublin Core is to meet the need of specialists across many
languages, it will also have to allow users in those languages to
define their own qualifiers.  And since the Dublin Core has so far been
used only in English and on the World-Wide Web, where indexing tags
must use only the English alphabet, its designers have not yet had to
cope with multiple sets of tags and qualifiers in multiple languages
and alphabets.  (Note that the language of the Dublin Core itself is
independent of the language of documents being described; records
created with the Thai Dublin Core could refer to articles in Japanese.)

<P>
These issues were discussed most recently at the Fourth
Dublin Core Workshop in Canberra, Australia, 3-5 March 1997
(<A HREF=http://www.dstc.edu.au/DC4/>http://www.dstc.edu.au/DC4/</A>).  This paper reports some conclusions
reached there and the consensus of a break-out group on how we might
move towards a manageable multiplicity of Dublin Cores in languages
other than English.

<P>
For the purposes of indexing and searching, equivalencies between
parallel Dublin Cores in multiple languages could be assured by an
agreed set of fifteen machine-readable indexing tags -- let's call
them, more generically, tokens -- standing for the fifteen Core
categories.  These tokens, embedded with HTML in documents (or wherever
else metadata may be placed), would flag the Core elements for
automatic Web indexers.  For better or for worse, the tokens currently
used for this are English words and will most likely remain so for now,
just as HTML tags for Web documents and the function words of most
computer programming languages are English-like.

<P>
But the problem is more complex when we consider qualifiers.  Qualifiers
guarantee interoperability of more precise semantics to the extent that
they are shared by communities of users.  Similarly, they would guarantee
interoperability across languages to the extent that they were shared
between Dublin Cores in different languages.  A few qualifiers, such as
"author", will be useful all over the world and will likely have universal
tokens.  One could therefore search for an author regardless of whether
the search form labelled it "author" or "putang" ("author" in Thai).

<P>
But as the Web increasingly becomes used for local and regional
purposes, it seems likely that qualifiers will proliferate for which
one will not need the global interoperability afforded by such widely
shared concepts.  As the Dublin Core is adopted more widely, Web-based
registries will evolve to document these qualifiers, both local and
universal, along with their tokens and definitions.  One can picture a
Thai registry for Dublin Core that listed fifty or so qualifiers shared
with other Dublin Cores alongside qualifiers specific to the Thai
language and Thai cataloging practice.

<P>
For a Dublin Core in Thai, one would ideally like to have a framework
for defining two parallel sets of tokens for qualifiers: a set of local
tokens expressed in the Thai language and alphabet, and a set of
matching universal tokens for those qualifiers that were shared with
other Dublin Cores.  Local tokens with no universal equivalents, while
useful locally, would simply be ignored by the global crawler
services.  Records created in Thailand, using local qualifiers, and
indexed by a global crawler service that ignored those qualifiers,
could still be retrieved in France via a "minimalist" search over the
fifteen Core categories.

<P>
For several reasons, this ideal cannot readily be realised with today's
Web technology.  The current HTML format for metadata (the META tag)
does not provide any standard way to distinguish between global and
local tokens.  And within HTML, machine-readable tokens -- whether
universal or local -- must be expressed in 7-bit ASCII (the English
alphabet from A to Z, plus numbers).

<P>
Just how serious these obstacles are for deploying Dublin Core in
languages other than English depends in part on how metadata will be
created in the future.  If we were to assume that metadata will be
typed in largely by hand -- and the most popular program for creating
Web pages today is Microsoft's Notepad, a simple text editor -- then
the limitation of ASCII will be a real problem.  However, it is much
more likely that users will type their descriptions into pop-up forms,
perhaps with help menus and validation procedures.  Software will take
care of formatting the metadata properly and with the appropriate tokens.
In such controlled environments, one might get around the limitations
of ASCII by using transliteration: a user would type a qualifier in Thai
letters and software would perform the necessary conversion into ASCII.
Of course, the raw results might no longer be entirely comprehensible
or editable by native speakers with plain text editors, so one could
object to this workaround on grounds of principle.

<P>
Fortunately, it seems likely that these limitations of ASCII and HTML
will be transcended by new technologies over the next year or two.
The character-set limitation on tag names will fade as 7-bit ASCII
is replaced by 16-bit Unicode, a code table that encompasses all the
characters of the world's most common scripts.  And the limitations on
metadata tagging will be transcended by two new Web formats: PICS-NG and
Web Collections.  PICS was originally designed to support systems for
rating Internet content (for example, to allow users to block access to
pornography), though it is evolving into a general system in which labels
and local tokens in many languages can be mapped onto generic metadata
structures (see <A HREF=http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/</A>).  Web Collections is a
recent initiative for designing a general way to define sets of metadata
(see <A HREF=http://www-ee.technion.ac.il/W3C/WebCollection.html>http://www-ee.technion.ac.il/W3C/WebCollection.html</A>).

<P>
Both PICS-NG and Web Collections will implement the basic elements
needed for multiple Dublin Cores: global tokens, local tokens, and local
descriptions.  Moreover, both of these metadata frameworks are being
developed by heterogenous communities of experts in resource description,
annotations, digital signatures, digital cash, and resource description,
and they have the support of the biggest software companies.  Indeed,
these initiatives are shaping the next big version of HTML itself.
It is quite possible that both of these proposals will be sanctioned by
the World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in June of 1997, after which it will
hopefully take but a few months to a year for stable browsers, servers,
and tools to come to market.  To the participants in the Canberra workshop
interested in creating Dublin Cores in languages other than English,
it seemed wiser to anticipate these new solutions than to invest much
energy in extending today's HTML.

<P>
While waiting for this deployment, communities can work on translating
the Dublin Core into various languages.  These translations will
need to be discussed and reworked until they really make sense to
native speakers.  The resulting descriptions will need to reflect as
precisely as possible the intent and semantic scope of the fifteen basic
Core elements.  Beyond that, local needs will determine the choice of
qualifiers and their correspondence or non-correspondence to qualifiers
in the English-language model.

<P>
As a simple first step, it seems desirable to make the descriptions of
Dublin Cores in languages other than English available on Web pages,
perhaps with lists of qualifiers, explanatory material, and examples
of usage.  These Web sites could be linked among themselves; indeed,
the Thai description of, say, the Subject element might usefully
be linked to the descriptions of that element in English and German.
Help pages might describe the advantages of using universal qualifiers.
Perhaps these interlinked Web servers could provide a platform for
future, more advanced registry services, such as automated lookups of
element values across languages, which could assist retrieval in ways we
cannot yet clearly imagine.  In such an infrastructure of peer servers,
no one model would dominate (in a logical sense), as the English-language
Dublin Core does now.

<P>
Researchers from several countries have indicated interest in establishing
Dublin Cores, and projects are already underway in Berlin, at the
Humboldt University in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute,
and in Bangkok, at the Technical Information Access Center of the
National Science and Technology Development Agency.  A mailing list
has been established to discuss Dublin Cores in multiple languages,
and further workshops are foreseen.  For further info, please contact
