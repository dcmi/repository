MoinMoin wikis (2003-2010).  From 2003 to 2010, DCMI used MoinMoin wikis --
"wikis", because they were not set up as one big wiki but as individual
instances of MoinMoin, thirteen to be exact. During this time, DCMI was careful
to say that the wikis had an uncertain future and that working groups should
only use them as temporary scratch pads.  The idea was that anything of
longer-term importance should eventually be converted into HTML and saved on
the main dublincore.org website; taking the initiative on this was to be the
responsibility of working groups.  Of course, some content potentially of
longer-term importance was never moved over, and there was no efficient way to
judge the future importance of materials, so at some point Tom archived all
contents of these wikis as static Web pages [2].
