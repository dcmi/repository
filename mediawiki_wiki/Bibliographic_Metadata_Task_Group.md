## Introduction 

The Bibliographic Metadata Task Group is a re-organization and successor of the DCMI/RDA Task Group.

The Task Group leaders are **Gordon Dunsire** and **Diane Hillmann**.

## Charter 

To define components of current and emerging library, publishing, and related bibliographic metadata standards as RDF vocabularies for use in developing Dublin Core application profiles and semantic mappings.

## Tasks 

### Ongoing 

Tasks identified at the [26 April 2012 meeting](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/BMTG_meeting_26_Apr_2012 "BMTG meeting 26 Apr 2012"):

- Task: Explore "obvious" mappings between known element sets and between value vocabularies, and identify issues, solutions, etc.
  - Action: Volunteers to contribute information about existing and developing alignments and mappings (what, who, when, etc.) to the Task Group wiki.
  - Outcome: [Maps between bibliographic vocabularies](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Maps_between_bibliographic_vocabularies "Maps between bibliographic vocabularies")

Tasks identified at the [5 September 2013 meeting](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/BMTG_meeting_5_Sep_2013 "BMTG meeting 5 Sep 2013"):

- Task: Monitor developments in open tools for managing extensions and refinements to bibliographic vocabularies.
  - Action: Members to inform the Group of relevant discussions and initiatives.
  - Outcome: Ongoing.

### Completed 

- Task: Contribute well-formed use cases to the DCMI Architecture Forum discussion on the Dublin Core abstract model (DCAM) and the RDF Working Group discussion on named graphs, if and when the opportunity arises.
  - Action: Interested members of the Bibliographic Metadata Task Group to join the [DC-ARCHITECTURE](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DC-ARCHITECTURE) and [DC-PROVENANCE](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=dc-provenance) mail lists and submit appropriate use cases in reponse to current and future calls. Also monitor the discussions of the [RDF Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/wiki/Main_Page) and the [Provenance Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/Main_Page) and respond to any calls for public submissions.
  - Outcome: Members of the Task Group contributed use cases and ideas to the discussion.

- Task: Give feedback on the draft ISBD-RDA/ONIX alignment and methodology.
  - Action: Members to make comments and suggestions in response to the [DC-RDA email on ISBD to RDA/ONIX mapping](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1204&L=dc-rda&P=716). 
  - Outcome: The alignment and methodology were approved at the [August 2012 meetings of the ISBD Review Group](http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/isbdrg/meeting_2012.pdf) in Helsinki, Finland. Version 1.1 of [Mapping of ISBD area 0 vocabularies to RDA/ONIX Framework vocabularies](http://www.rda-jsc.org/docs/6JSC-ISBD-Discussion-2-Mapping.pdf) and a [discussion paper](http://www.rda-jsc.org/docs/6JSC-ISBD-Discussion-2.pdf) were submitted to JSC/RDA and the [JSC response](http://www.rda-jsc.org/docs/6JSC-ISBD-Discussion-1-and-2-JSC-response.pdf) has been published.

- Task: Give feedback on the draft IFLA guidelines on translations of namespaces.
  - Action: Members to make comments and suggestions in response to the [DC-RDA email on Guidelines on translations of IFLA namespaces](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1204&L=dc-rda&P=5240). Feedback should be emailed to DC-RDA. 
  - Outcome: The draft guidelines were discussed at the [August 2012 meeting of the IFLA Namespaces Technical Group](http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/classification-and-indexing/namespaces/namespaces-tg-meeting-2012.pdf) in Helsinki, Finland. Further amendments to the guidelines were suggested and approved at the [August 2013 meeting of the IFLA Namespaces Technical Group](http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/classification-and-indexing/namespaces/namespaces-tg-meeting-2013.pdf) in Singapore and subsequently published as [Guidelines for translations of IFLA namespaces in RDF, version 2.0, August 2013](http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/classification-and-indexing/namespaces/iflanamespacetranslationguidelines2_0.docx).

## Announcements 

- The DCMI Bibliographic Metadata Task Group will [meet at DC-2013](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/BMTG_meeting_5_Sep_2013 "BMTG meeting 5 Sep 2013") on **Thursday September 5 2013 in Lisbon, Portugal, 16.30-18.00**.

- In preparation for [DC-2013](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/dc-2013) in **Lisbon, Portugal** , the Task Group has become involved in a proposal for a [full-day session](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Proposal_for_a_full-day_session_in_Lisbon "Proposal for a full-day session in Lisbon"). Task Group members and others interested in participating in the session are urged to look over the proposal and make comments or suggestions on the Task Group discussion list. 
- The DCMI Bibliographic Metadata Task Group held its inaugural [meeting on April 26, 2012](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/BMTG_meeting_26_Apr_2012 "BMTG meeting 26 Apr 2012") in **London**. The meeting identified a number of tasks for the Group for the remainder of 2012.

## Discussion List 

The group will continue to use the [DC-RDA mailing list](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-rda.html), in order to retain easy access to the discussion archive. To post, use this address: DC-RDA@JISCMAIL.AC.UK.

## Background 

Prior to the DC-2011 conference, the co-Chairs of the DCMI/RDA Task Group (Gordon Dunsire and Diane Hillmann) reviewed its goals and activities in the light of the changing information environment of bibliographic metadata standards, linked data, and the Semantic Web. A proposal to expand and repurpose the Group was subsequently submitted to, and accepted by, the Dublin Core Advisory Board:

- [DCMI/RDA Task Group Repurposing Proposal](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI/RDA_Task_Group_Repurposing_Proposal "DCMI/RDA Task Group Repurposing Proposal")

The DCMI/RDA Task Group Historical Archives are still available (moved from the old DCMI wiki):
