# Education Committee 

## Committee Charge

The Education & Outreach Committee determines policies and procedures and develops the master planning calendar for DCMI education and training, user best practice documentation, and outreach activities. The Committee actively identifies potential areas for development and delivery of education and training in support of innovative metadata design and best practice and develops user documentation and other types of published resources supporting learners and teachers and trainers. The Committee develops educational programs including tutorials, workshops, online "how-to" recipes and webinars and is responsible for recruiting chairs to organize educational programs. The Committee manages DCMI's outreach through website announcements and social media channels.

## Scope, Work & Reporting
<pre> Scope: Advises the Advisory Board on education and training, and communications and publications.
   Reporting: The Committee Chairs report to the Advisory Board Chair in a manner set out in the Advisory Board Policies &amp; Procedures.

## Scope 

- Advises the OC and Directorate on education and training, and communications and publications.
- Shall actively identify potential areas for development and delivery of education and training in support of resource description, including documentation and other types of publication.
- Shall promptly report any ad all actions to the OC: Proposed actions shall be reported to the OC in advance whenever possible.

_**(STUART NOTE)** Who develops and follows through with webinars and tutorials?_

_**(JB)** Good question about boundary of advisory vs. execution. I'd suggest that webinar chair should be an appointed role, with a separate role for tutorial chair. The Education Committee would identify candidates. An important consideration for webinars is that they are an attractive membership benefit, ideally free for members. E.g. ASIST webinars are very low cost to mount, should be free to members and subsidized by paying participants. NISO webinars are not a viable membership benefit but may have other benefits to DCMI._

_**(SS)** 100% agree, Joseph. I, too, have been thinking about the ASIST webinar-to-membership structure as a good incentive model while keeping webinar access for non-members quite reasonable. Also, DCMI can ride on the ASIST technical architecture as soon as we have a means for planning and executing._
