## Managing [Schema.org Alignment Issues](https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/issues) in GitHub 

1. Anyone wishing to create an issue, or comment on an issue, must first get a free GitHub account at [https://github.com/plans](https://github.com/plans)
2. Raise an issue here by pressing "New Issue": [https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/issues](https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/issues)
3. Every line in every file has a URI, so in an issue, one can reference a specific line number in a specific file as in: [https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings\_schema.org.xml#L108](https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L108)
4. One can also reference a specific version of a file: [https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#mappings\_schema.org.xml](https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#mappings_schema.org.xml)
5. One can insert a comment directly: [https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#commitcomment-1089282](https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#commitcomment-1089282)
6. In creating issues, Corey followed Kirsten's pattern of using the current text of a particular triple as the issue's "title", and including some text & a line number for the \*first\* line of the RDF-XML of that triple: [https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings\_schema.org.xml#L57](https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L57)
7. Currently users have to be logged in to comment. We \*might\* be able to change that, but may not want to. What we need to decide next is how these get "assigned" and eventually "resolved".
