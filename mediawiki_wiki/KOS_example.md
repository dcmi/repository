# KOS as intellectual products -- How can they be modelled 

Note: This model does not address the question of whether a new version is a new work when there are significant changes of title, content, and authorship occur.

The following is an attempt of modelling _ASIST Thesaurus_.

## The Entities and Relationships 

• The thesaurus as a whole is a _work_.

• Different versions (such as Version 1994 in English, Version 2005 in English, Version 2012 in French) are different _expressions_ of this work.

• The printed edition of the 2010 English version and the SKOS Linked data representation of the same version are examples of _manifestations_.

A subset of _expressions_ and _manifestations_ of this work is illustrated below.
