<pre>Process for raising issues in GitHub:

1. Anyone wishing to create an issue, or comment on an issue, must
   first get a free GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com/plans" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/plans</a>

2. Raise an issue here by pressing "New Issue":
   <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/issues" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/issues</a> 

3. Every line in every file has a URI, so in an issue, one can reference a
   specific line number in a specific file as in:
   <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L108" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L108</a>

4. One can also reference a specific version of a file:
   <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#mappings_schema.org.xml" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#mappings_schema.org.xml</a>
   ...and insert a comment directly:
   <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#commitcomment-1089282" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/commit/9f8467cd749954963dbd8f443f1e74439bebb67a#commitcomment-1089282</a>

5. In creating issues, Corey followed Kirsten's pattern of using the current
   text of a particular triple as the issue's "title", and including some text &amp; a
   line number for the *first* line of the RDF-XML of that triple:
   <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L57" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dcmi/schema.org/blob/master/mappings_schema.org.xml#L57</a>

6. Currently users have to be logged in to comment. We *might* be able to
   change that, but may not want to. What we need to decide next is how
   these get "assigned" and eventually "resolved".
