## DCMI Schema.org Alignment Task Group 

A Task Group of the DCMI Architecture Forum<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>

Co-chair: Tom Baker and Dan Brickley

### Status as of November 2014 

[http://dcmi.github.io/schema.org/mappings.html](http://dcmi.github.io/schema.org/mappings.html) is probably the best link

Background details (see also [https://github.com/rvguha/schemaorg/issues/84](https://github.com/rvguha/schemaorg/issues/84)):

The Task Group was active between October 2011 (DC-2011 in Pittsburgh) and May 2012, date of its last telecon [2]. We started with a first-draft mapping prepared by Bernard [3]. At first we tried to map to the OWL representation of Schema.org prepared by [http://schema.rdfs.org](http://schema.rdfs.org) (see mapping list [4], last edited in January 2012).

We got hung up on process -- e.g., how to pull together documentation, first for deciding on the mappings and then for documenting them to the world. A hand-edited wiki page [5] put the formal definitions side-by-side, but clearly this was not going to be either satisfactory to use or sustainable to maintain. Some of our concerns were captured on an issues page in the DCMI wiki [6].

We moved the mappings to Github [7]. In February, Antoine was talking about embedding some mappings in Europeana Web pages. In April, Antoine posted a version of the DCMI/Schema.org mappings in RDFa -- our last word on the topic before discussion petered out [8,9,10]. One advantage we saw in the RDFa representation was the ability to cite a specific mapping (e.g., [11]).

Around this time (April-May 2012), Dan was working on some ideas w.r.t. DC/Schema.org mappings (see [12,13,14] and a private Google doc [15]).

This discussion morphed into a discussion between Dan and Tom about how to ensure that DCMI and Schema.org URIs resolved to better documentation which led, on the DCMI side, to the publication of DCMI Metadata Terms with RDFa [16].

As of November 2014, Dan is maintaining Schema.org mappings in [17]. If we wanted to glean further mappings, or re-boot the mapping process, then the place to start (on the DCMI side) would be the RDFa document last edited in April 2012 [8].

### Telecons 

2012-05-14: [Agenda](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Telecon_20120514), [Report](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Telecon_20120514_Report)

2012-04-05: [Agenda](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Telecon_20120405), [Report](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Telecon_20120405_Report): source of mappings, publication form, use of RDFa, Schema.org semantics

2012-01-09: [Agenda](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind1201&L=dc-architecture&P=31754), Report: Informal call to discuss the practicalities of issues tracking and publication.

2011-12-12: [Agenda](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Telecon_20111212 "Schema.org Alignment/Telecon 20111212"), [Report](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Telecon_20111212_Report "Schema.org Alignment/Telecon 20111212 Report"): Methods and process for deciding alignments; start to discuss alignment proposal.

### Purpose and objectives 

The Schema.org initiative<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> aims at providing terms that webmasters can embed in Web pages to improve search results. For simplicity of adoption, the initiative is defining all of its terms in its own namespace. Where Schema.org terms overlap with DCMI metadata terms, this Task Group will define and publish formal mappings.

The Task Group will work with the maintainers of Schema.RDFS.org -- "a complementary effort by people from the Linked Data community to support Schema.org deployment and usage with a special focus on Linked Data"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> -- which has already published a placeholder for future mappings to Dublin Core<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup>. The Task Group will identify use cases for the mappings and define a process and workflow to create, publish, and maintain the mappings.

Membership in the Task Group is open to any interested member of the public. Unless the volume of traffic warrants the creation of a separate mailing list, discussion in the Task Group will take place on the [dc-architecture](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-architecture.html) mailing list.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup> (See also an initial [scratchpad for issues](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/MappingIssues "Schema.org Alignment/MappingIssues").)

Starting with a [draft set of mappings](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Mappings "Schema.org Alignment/Mappings") from Bernard Vatant, the group aims at completing a review and publishing a final version in the first quarter of 2012.
