## How are the persistence and reliability of metadata required for the operation and management of a given library, museum, etc. assured if records are "everywhere and nowhere?" 

National and authoritative agencies have a significant role to play in ensuring reliability and the persistence of URIs for resources. There is no reason why the traditional supply chain of quality metadata should not persist, and any specific application should be able to filter the metadata it uses. Uses may not see much difference in applications in the context of a specific library and its local collections, but the Semantic Web makes it easier to use data in many different contexts. Information is becoming ever more distributed at global scale rather than remaining localized, so wider contexts are becoming more important for users. It will not be possible to assure the quality of metadata using traditional methods in these wider contexts. Instead, techniques such as statistical reasoning (9 out of 10 triples say the subject of this book is quantum mechanics) will come into play. User feedback mechanisms will become important: data that are thought to be less reliable can be marked as such on displays, and users should be encouraged to agree/disagree/verify by leaving comments or using a rating system. These techniques are already successfully used in other areas of the Web.
