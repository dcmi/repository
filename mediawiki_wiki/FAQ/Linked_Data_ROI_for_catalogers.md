## As a production cataloger of original material, I am not seeing Linked Data as saving labor for me and my colleagues, only as providing opportunities for others to leverage our work. What's the business model for supporting the work of a national bibliography, i.e., for verifying and controlling data? 

In many cases, the development of national bibliographies is a collaborative effort involving multiple library agencies, commercial bibliographic metadata suppliers, and publishers. The Semantic Web environment encourages such sharing of data, and allows a wider range of participation. A goal of most "national" bibliographies is to record and promote access to the bibliographic culture of the relevant country, region, or language group. Linked Data operates in both directions, so leverage by other communities results in increased access to bibliographic metadata and the resources they describe. National agencies will have a significant role in data verification, in the sense that URIs based on the domain of a recognizable, authoritative agency are more likely to be trustworthy than those from a non-library source. So it is important that national agencies contribute library Linked Data to the Semantic Web. Data cannot be controlled in the traditional way of creating a master record to be re-used by other libraries; at best, a core or master set of triples might be created. But it is a moot point as to how much control is actually exerted in the traditional environment: some libraries catalogue from scratch without checking for the existence of a master record; copies of a master record are often de-coupled and amended for local purposes, producing duplicate metadata which cannot be effectively recombined by machine (the de-duplication problem); different national cataloging rules result in different metadata for the same resource; catalogers make mistakes; etc.
