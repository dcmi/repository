<dl><dt>What do you do when you disagree with triples assigned to your item (i.e., statements made by others about your own resources)?
</dt></dl>


Triples are statements. If you disagree with a statement, you can publish your own, different statement. In most cases, it will be the object value which you disagree with (e.g. This book has publication date 1984 vs This book has publication date 1994). Your triple (statement) will then "compete" with the one you disagree with, but it will be up to others to decide which is correct (if either).

In principle, you can create a triple whose subject is the triple you disagree with -- a triple that questions the validity of the other triple. This requires "that triple" to have its own URI; assigning a URI to a triple is known as reification. Best practice methods for doing this are still evolving.

Alternatively, you can filter out triples that you disagree with from your local application. One cannot remove someone else's triple from the Web any more than one can remove someone else's Web page. (Would you want some else to have the ability to remove one of your triples?) Metadata provenance methods are the object of active standards development, especially in the W3C Working Groups for Provenance and RDF, and it is likely that common frameworks of practice will evolve in due course.
