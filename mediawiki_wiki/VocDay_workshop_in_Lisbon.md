## VocDay Workshop Draft Program 

Vocabulary Day 2013 is designed to inform and focus discussion over a variety of vocabulary development and maintenance topics, identified by the DCMI Vocabulary Management Community based on its [full-day workshop in The Hague](/mediawiki_wiki/DC-2011_Vocabulary_Special_Session/Meeting_Report), in 2011. Participation in VocDay is open to anyone who has an interest in these topics, and background materials will be available well before DC-2013 for those desiring some prior preparation. The Day is organized in collaboration with the [DCMI Bibliographic Metadata Task Group](/mediawiki_wiki/Bibliographic_Metadata_Task_Group).

In addition to providing an opportunity for practitioners both experienced and new to these topics to come together and focus their attention on these critical issues, the sessions will aim to look forward towards addressing those needs for best practices documentation. Sessions will begin with short background presentations to set the stage for discussion by attendees. In all sessions, discussion will emphasize the definition of practical goals and tasks designed to move the community forward. Ideally, the participants will be sufficiently encouraged to join task groups to continue the discussion and work towards recommendations and actions.

The sessions planned are described below. Each session will last approximately 1.5 hours with two in the morning and two in the afternoon. Generous breaks between sessions will provide time for networking and the generation of ideas!

- 1. Vocabulary sustainability (Leader: Bernard Vatant, MONDECA) [Agenda](/mediawiki_wiki/Agenda). Services such as Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) which are tracking vocabularies in use in a variety of domains, report that they see increasing numbers of vocabularies for which there seems to be no active management (or for which a management entity cannot be determined). Discussion topics will include criteria for evaluating sustainability for vocabularies, what kind of measures could be taken to increase the likelihood that vocabularies will survive, what can be done about ‘orphan’ vocabularies, and whether a role can be taken on by DCMI.

- 2. Multilingual vocabulary development and extension (Leader: Daniel Vila Suero, Ontology Engineering Group (OEG), Universidad Politécnica de Madrid) [Agenda2](/mediawiki_wiki/Agenda2). In a global world, vocabularies enabled for multilingual environments are increasingly in demand. In this session, discussion will include applicable standards (and examples), with a possible outcome a charge to a small group to begin developing some best practices.

- 3. Extension of element and value vocabularies (Leader: Richard Wallis, OCLC) [Agenda3](/mediawiki_wiki/Agenda3). As the notions of ‘reuse’ shift in favor of extension strategies, the lack of best practices for such extension represent a yawning gap. Specialized communities in particular may be interested in this question, as they look towards more general vocabularies for a base for special extension. This session will begin with a panel discussion describing some extension strategies in use in various communities, before moving on to discussion about strategies for developing documentation on best practices.

- 4. Making mapping real (Leader: Gill Hamilton, National Library of Scotland) [Agenda4](/mediawiki_wiki/Agenda4). Are your strings in a fankle or your things unmentionable? This session will cover practical issues associated with mapping linked open datasets from a local environment to the global semantic web. Issues will be illustrated by examples encountered at National Library of Scotland. Topics covered will include: DODLOD@NLS; LoC(h)-Getty; two other lochs; Wikipedia wickedness and the Elusive loch of Shandon (a watery Brigadoon); innumerate Scots and their thirds, forths and firths; The Germans (a Basil Fawlty moment); and … Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.
