The DataCite Metadata Kernel is being developed for metadata representing data objects, and to help standardize citation for and sharing research data. This presentation introduced DataCite and gave an overview of the DataCite Metadata Kernel; attention was also given to <a href="http://n2t.net/ezid" class="external text" rel="nofollow">EZID</a> for creating and managing unique, persistent identifiers.

Each presentation was followed by a brief Q & A session. Overriding themes included:

- The need for persistent identifiers for data as demonstrated by EZID.
- Interest in how data citation folds into the scholarly communications framework (Todd and Joan’s talks addressed this).
- Issues and challenges relating instructing data producers on the value of metadata, metadata quality, and organizational metadata workflow (Jian and Lynn’s presentations).

The last segment of the meeting included a very brief open discussion. Jane asked if there was interest in continuing the community, and the response was unanimously positive. Stu Weibel emphasized the importance of the DC-SAM community as a major player for the future of DCMI. His remarks underscored the growing need to dialog about challenges relating to managing digital data. Attendees suggested holding a DC-SAM meeting or workshop at another conference, such as JCDL or ECDL to continue discussion beyond DCMI. Jane expressed interest in more formally supporting the DataCite efforts, given needs expressed by DC-SAM members.

In closing, brief announcements were made about the change in community leadership, pending DCAB (Dublin Core Advisory Board) approval, and individuals checking w/their supervisors. Results: Stu Weiblel will step down as community co-leader; Jian Qin, Associate Professor, SIS/Syracuse Univ. will come on board as a new co-leader; and Jane Greenberg will remain as a co-community leader.

In closing, Jane acknowledged Gregory Tourte, School of Geographical Sciences, the University of Bristol and Emma Tonkin, UKOLN, for their help with technology for the session, and Greg’s extra talent in helping to connect w/Joan Starr in California.
