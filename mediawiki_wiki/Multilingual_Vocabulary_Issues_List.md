This issues list below has been collected by members of the DCMI Vocabulary Management Community who are interested in multilingual and multiregional vocabularies. The purpose of the list is to share issues and areas the team has been discussing as we prepare to prioritize areas of research. If you would like to suggest new issues for the list or add some information to an existing one, contact mikelauruhn@gmail.com. In addition, discussion about the issues captured here can be sent to the DCMI Vocabulary Management Listserv.

1. When expanding a vocabulary to multiple regions and variations of languages occur, what is the best practice for representing them? Examples include Spanish from Spain or Spanish from Latin America; Portuguese used in Portugal vs Brazil; U.K. and U.S.A. English.

2. Multiregional vocabularies in which relations (hierarchical or ontological) vary between regions. What is the best practice for representing the relations in a single model? Are there existing models or standards that attempt to address issues like this? What are the maintenance issues and best practices for managing such a Model?

3. Governance issues that are unique to multilingual vocabularies, especially knowledge responsibilities are shared around multiple stakeholders
