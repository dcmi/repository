**Moderators: Karen Rollitt and Shigeo Sugimoto**

Shigeo Sugimoto and Karen Rollitt, the moderator of this community, introduced themselves and described the activities of the DCMI Localization and Internationalization Community. The focus is to bring metadata issues that exist in the local community to the global community (internationalization) and issues from the global community to the local community (localization). Community group members, from Spain, China, Korea, New Zealand and Germany attended the meeting.

The discussion item was translation of DCMI documentation into local languages.

**1. Translating DCMI documentation**

Makx Dekkers, Managing Director, DCMI reported that there is huge variation in the translations of DCMI documentation. Some translations include the full range of DCMI documentation and have well-organized and permanent links to resources. At the other extreme minimal translation is done and links disappear on a regular basis. Providing guidelines for translators to prevent this and other issues would be very beneficial.

**2. Benefits of translating DCMI documentation**

Translation of DC documentation greatly assists in the global uptake and development of DC. Stefanie Ruehle of KIM reported that German translations of DCMES and the Singapore Framework assists in DC training programmes for librarians and technicians. KIM next aim ito translate the Guidelines for Application Profiles, with some small local variations.

**3. Recommending DCMI documentation to translate**

The meeting unanimously agreed that translating the 15 core Dublin Core elements is the ideal place to start a DC translation program.

Thomas Baker questioned whether there is a need to provide some kind of usage document that would provide a high-level introduction to DC. This type of document could assist with uptake and use of DC in local languages. Tom would like user comments on whether a gap exists in DC documentation and questioned whether there is a need for a high-level document containing, for example, concrete examples. A high-level document, and other DCMI documentation, could contain some of the following topics: a) More guidance for each dc element in a more structured way, made available as a revised DCMI metadata terms document b) More context about what DC metadata is in 2009 c) Guidance about what is happening out in the wider web, e.g. RDFa and linked data and the tools available d) How to combine DC metadata with other vocabularies using RDF e) More about interoperability levels for Dublin Core Metadata f) Links to case studies, for example UK, USA, and the Dutch government’s take up of RDFa and linked data, as well as current DC implementations.

The meeting group then discussed some of the DC documentation that could be beneficial to translate for local DC uptake. Suggestions included: a) the two main DCMI web pages, "Metadata basics" and "DCMI specifications", which provide high level summaries of Dublin Core Metadata b) DC Application Profile documentation c) Singapore Framework

_Action:_ Shigeo Sugimoto, Stephanie Ruehle and Karen Rollitt, during DC2009 conference, to list DC specifications, audience and assign a translation priority level.

**4. Local DC translation implementations**

Keven Liu reported that in China a wiki has been setup with DCMI translated documentation and a call for volunteers has been made to develop more translations. Stephanie reported that in Germany the DCMES is available as a pdf document and in a DCMI registry. There is a lot of value in translating the Singapore Framework.

**5. Translation guidelines: approval process**

Shigeo queried the approval process for the translation guidelines. It is likely that once complete the AB Board and Oversight Committee will review the guidelines.

_Action:_ Tom to raise with Makx the approval process for translation guidelines.

_Action:_ Translation Task Group: to develop a systematic approach / process / workflow for those wishing to translate DCMI documentation.

Issues arising for the Translation Task Group: 1. How to ensure authorized versions of DC translations, DCMI are unable to approve all language translations 2. DCAM is difficult to translate. 3. Links to local translations from DCMI website disappear 4. Presentation of DC translations on DCMI website is producer oriented. 5. Owners of translations sometimes difficult to trace
