## Open-World Design 

The Web offers possibilities for knowledge management that differ fundamentally from established, pre-Web methods. Traditional IT environments are "closed worlds" in which data is carefully controlled, with document formats and database schemas tailored for specific applications. Closed-world address well-defined, bounded problems with efficiency. Application designers can dictate the structure of "valid" information with precision.

Since the early 1990s, the Web has placed local sources of information into a new global context, making it dramatically easier to pull information from multiple sources and giving rise to what is sometimes called an "open world mindset" for knowledge management.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> The open-world mindset tolerates, even assumes, that the information at hand is incomplete and may be supplemented by incorporating information from other, possibly unanticipated, sources. Data integration is based on conformance not to fixed, ad-hoc data structures but to a generic model for expressing data. Data integration may be partial, based on descriptive attributes that may only partially overlap. New information can be incorporated without invalidating information already present. Systems can be rolled out early, with simple designs and focused on key, high-return requirements, then flexibly evolve as new sources of information become available and new requirements emerge.

Given the current availability of software, working with open-world data can be more challenging than managing data with familiar, time-tested, closed-world applications such as relational databases. However, systems designed with closed-world assumptions are vulnerable to breaking as new sources of information are added. Systems designed with open-world assumptions are, in this sense, more robust -- less "brittle." Open-world design principles are a good fit to the dynamism of today's rapidly evolving Web environment.

Note that in this context, "open-world" refers to principles of application design. It specifically does not imply that the data is openly accessible ("open data"). Open-world design can apply equally well to proprietary data that is maintained behind corporate or organizational firewalls.
