## Dublin Core 

Variants: Dublin Core, The Dublin Core, Dublin Core Metadata Element Set

"The Dublin Core", also known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, is a set of fifteen "core" elements (properties) for describing resources. (Or Andy's: "Dublin Core (DC) is a metadata standard that provides a vocabulary for describing the "core" attributes of resources, often in the context of resource discovery and/or management.") The elements are: Creator, Contributor, Publisher, Title, Date, Language, Format, Subject, Description, Identifier, Relation, Source, Type, Coverage, and Rights. The fifteen-element Dublin Core, originally drafted with thirteen elements in 1995, has been formally standardized as ISO 15836:2009, ANSI/NISO Z39.85, and the IETF [RFC 5013](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5013) (@cites). Metadata based on the fifteen elements is used in countless implementations, and the Dublin Core is one of the top metadata vocabularies in use today, particularly for Semantic-Web and Linked-Data applications. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is part of a larger set of DCMI Metadata Terms (see related entry "DCMI Metadata Terms").

The Dublin Core was the first result of a process which engendered a wider "Dublin Core community" and led to the creation of a Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. (See entries for "Dublin Core Metadata Initiative" and "Dublin Core, used as an adjective").

Besides The Dublin Core, Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, and Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), described in separate entries, "Dublin Core" is commonly used as an adjective in the following:

- "Dublin Core community". Participants in DCMI mailing lists, task groups, specialist communities, and annual conferences constitute a loosely defined Dublin Core community.

- "Dublin Core metadata". In the late 1990s, "Dublin Core metadata" referred to metadata based on the fifteen-element Dublin Core, has come to refer what might best be described as a "style", "form", or "flavor" of metadata -- a style that has evolved from efforts to put the fifteen elements into the context of a coherent approach to metadata on the World Wide Web generally. As Dublin Core metadata now denotes a type of metadata based on a generic model, it is often pointed out that Dublin Core metadata does not actually require use of The Dublin Core or of any other DCMI metadata terms. The definitive characteristic of the Dublin Core style is the "Dublin Core application profile".

- "Dublin Core application profiles". Analogously to "Dublin Core Metadata", the term "Dublin Core application profiles" referred in circa 2000 through 2004 to any metadata specification that "used" the Dublin Core, usually in combination with other metadata vocabularies. With the development of the DCMI Abstract Model in 2004 through 2007, the term "Dublin Core application profile" was narrowed in scope to refer specifically to application profiles based on the DCMI Abstract Model. Weak uptake of the DCMI Abstract Model, together with the emergence of alternative methods for documenting Linked Data patterns, may be loosening the dependence of the "DC application profile" notion on the DCMI Abstract Model per se in favor of a basis in Linked Data methods more generally.
