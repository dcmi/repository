Transcribed Flipchart sheets from DC-2011 Vocabulary Management pre-conf.

1. Principles of acceptable use

<pre> Copy and modify by align
   Document governance policies
   Commercial use: AGROVOC free for non-commercial
       Difficult
       If you make open, hard to restrict commercial uses
   Rules of conduct
       Only create narrower terms in your area of interest
       Use general
   Wide use is good--makes indispensable
   Attach string: not for commercial purposes?
   If you use my URIs …
</pre>

2. Are there best practices for maintenance roles?

Community impact/control editorial, IP control

Principles

<pre> 1. Start with sustainable institutional backing
</pre>

Scenario

<pre>Starts with org, outgrows org → broader community
Value proposition of sharing vocab (for a maintainer)
Subscription to cover costs
    --people using your vocab: gives you access to their info

How can adaptations be handled?
People using your vocabulary incorrectly?

Manage process for additions/change
    Technically sound/unsound
    Allow to do in vocab or out (and link)
        --AGROVOC: Chinese editor can add as many synonyms as they want
        --AGROVOC: --&gt;Community--&gt;Roles
</pre>

<pre>Selection- in LD context, finding right properties for dataset
    --Issue: knowing what’s available (Swoogle not working)
    --Issue: available on web?
    --Issue: open vs. proprietary
    --Issue: level of complexity
    --Issue: maintenance--up-to-date, services?
    --Issue: trusted authorship
    --Issue: persistence policy
    --Issue: extensive use (Mondeca has findings)
    --Issue: familiar labels

Discovery of properties different from discover of vocabs--search for props a method
In LOD world can we be less conservative about choice
</pre>

<pre>Quality Control--how much?
    -- conflicting statements? What to do?
    -- does the source use constraints on vocabs, domains, etc. Is it obvious?
    -- conflicts due to lack of quality (typos, [can’t read] preferences?)
    -- trust is not y/n, requires more knowledge of context and POV
    -- domain may be contained in URI (but not for PURLs, maybe?)
    -- focus of source important, coverage may be limited
        -- suggests issues of intermediary needs

What is a vocabulary? remains a question
    -- source? obvious?
    -- we may chose sources that are imperfect
</pre>

<pre>Linked data--requires? assumes?
    -- distribution
    -- redundancy
    -- “like emergence of natural language” [B. Vatant]
        -- vocabs are similar, require time and curation where top down and bottom up meet
</pre>

<pre>Documentation
    -- structural &amp; description of vocabulary itself (editorial, scope, extension policies)
    -- multilingual aspects
    -- disciplinary perspective
    -- multiple vocabulary adoption (layered)
    -- scientific vs. general audience
    -- shifting use and context with volatile vocabs = maintenance nightmare
        -- mgmt strategy critical in determining relevance of issues
        -- time based issues (ex. oil importing countries, membership changes over time, see archivists for more on this)
        -- temporal drift
</pre>

USE CASES NEEDED

[<img alt="IMG 0454.jpg" src="/mediawiki_wiki/images/IMG_0454.jpg" width="700" height="937">](/mediawiki_wiki/images/IMG_0454.jpg)[whose handwriting?] [which session?]

<pre>Rights of stakeholders
    -- governance charter [for AGROVOC]
        -- IP rights for language versions

Governance
    -- use cases
    -- roles and responsibilities
    -- uses [can’t read]
   
Depends on life cycle
    -- maintenance phase
    -- exit strategy/preservation

Community impact / central control
Broader adoption / top-down development
Encouraging adoption → input from broader community
Rights
Involving experts in building
    -- involvement
</pre>

<pre>Constraints
    -- Must pay attention to semantics
    -- constraints of domain or hierarchy
    -- fuzzy match / no match, what then?
    -- purpose of mapping relates to usefulness
    -- ‘levels’ of mapping (documented as part of process) (identifiers)
    -- provenance important to carry process &amp; documentation
    -- Logical consistency
    -- fear of using ‘exact match’ (close match less daunting0

Role of rating &amp; quality assessment
</pre>

[700px](/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=IMG_0452.jpg "File:IMG 0452.jpg")[Diane’s handwriting] [Mapping/alignment pt.2]

<pre>Remaining questions
    -- Process of mapping
    -- in mapping, who sez?
    -- maintenance of mapping
        -- in reciprocal mapping, how to reflect change/preserve change
    -- mapping lifecycle needs best practice guidelines
    -- methods of mapping, needs documentation, best practices, registration
    --Mapping predicates are a vocabulary themselves (UMLS as mapping predicates)
    -- ALA subcommittee (of ALCTS) gathered predicates some years ago (ask Jane Greenberg about it)
    -- Should look at ISO 25964.2 → thesaurus standard, not yet approved but in process
</pre>
