Description of document:
This document lists the step-by-step process for the approval of five types of proposals:

2. Proposals for DCMI Recommendations
3. Proposals for DCMI Recommended Resources
4. Proposals for Application Profiles as DCMI Recommended Resources
5. Proposals for DCMI Process Documents.

### About proposals in general

There are five categories of proposals:

- Proposed changes to DCMI metadata terms
- Proposals for DCMI Recommendations
- Proposals for DCMI Recommended Resources
- Proposals for Application Profiles as DCMI Recommended Resources
- Proposals for DCMI Process Documents

Proposals can come from the Directorate (e.g. as a result of an outsourced
activity), Affiliates, Communities, Task Groups, other organizations external to DCMI, or
any individual.

Any document that goes into the approval process needs to be submitted to the DCMI
Managing Director using the Proposal Submission Form. Proposals may be submitted as a link to an external
resource in plain text, HTML or PDF.

The Directorate acknowledges receipt and decides whether a document falls in one of the
five categories, possibly in consultation with the Advisory Board. A first decision on
whether DCMI will accept a proposal for consideration is communicated to the submitter no
later than two months after submission with specification of the process and timeline
foreseen.

### 1. Proposals related to DCMI metadata terms

Proposals related to existing DCMI metadata terms (including editorial comments or
updating obsolete references) are evaluated by the DCMI Usage Board within four weeks
from submission. If the advice from the Usage Board is negative, the Directorate rejects
the proposal and informs the submitter with reasons for rejection. If the advice is positive
and the proposed change is substantial, the Directorate prepares for public comment.
Minor editorial changes will be made immediately without a public comment period.

Any comments from the UB are communicated to submitters who have the opportunity to
make modifications based upon those comments. If major changes are made, the proposal needs
to be re-submitted.

Public comment is open for a minimum of four weeks, announced by the Directorate
on DC-GENERAL and with a news item on the DCMI Web site and published on the Public Comment
page. If serious objections are expressed by the public, the Directorate decides what to do,
in consultation with the Usage Board: (a) reject the proposal and inform the submitter
with reasons, giving the option to re-submit with changes, or (b) ask submitters to make
minor changes to the proposal.

If no serious objections are received, the Usage Board incorporates the proposal in
the documentation of Dublin Core terms, after which the Directorate publishes an updated
version of the DCMI Metadata Terms on the DCMI Web site and announces to DC-GENERAL and with
a news item on the DCMI Web site.

### 2. Proposals for other DCMI Recommendations

Examples: 
- DCMI Abstract Model,
- Namespace Policy

The DCMI Directorate assigns the status of Proposed Recommendation or (in cases where
a Recommendation already exists) Proposed Revised Recommendation.

Proposals go through an initial review in the Advisory Board for at least four weeks.
After negative review, the Directorate informs the submitter with reasons for
rejection. Modified proposals can be re-submitted. If AB review is positive, the
Directorate prepares for public comment. Any comments from the AB are communicated to
submitters who get the opportunity to make modifications based upon those comments. If
major changes are made, the proposal needs to be re-submitted.

Public comment is open for a minimum of four weeks, announced by the Directorate
on DC-GENERAL and with a news item on the DCMI Web site and published on the Public Comment
page. If serious objections are expressed by the public, the Directorate decides what to do,
in consultation with the Advisory Board: (a) reject the proposal and inform the submitter
with reasons, giving the option to re-submit with changes, or (b) ask submitters to make
minor changes to the proposal.

After successful public comment, the Directorate publishes the Recommendation on the DCMI
Web site and announces to DC-GENERAL and with a news item on the DCMI Web site.

### 3. Proposals for DCMI Recommended Resources

Examples: 
- AskDCMI,
- Using Dublin Core

In general, evaluation and subsequent acceptance or rejection of proposed DCMI
Recommended Resources are at the discretion of the Directorate, in consultation with
the Advisory Board. The procedure for Application Profiles is different and is described
in Section 4 below.

The decision on acceptance or rejection is taken by the Directorate and communicated to
the submitter no later than six months after the submission of the proposal. Rejections
are communicated to the submitter with reasons for rejection. The Directorate announces
the acceptance of proposals to DC-GENERAL and with a news item on the DCMI Web site.
The Recommended Resource is published on the DCMI Web site (possibly as a link to the
resource, for example as is the case with the question-and-answer service AskDCMI).

### 4. Proposals for Application Profiles as DCMI Recommended Resources

Application Profiles submitted for review are assigned to the Usage Board and
evaluated according to published criteria. The Usage Board advises the Directorate on
acceptance or rejection of such proposals.

Decision on acceptance or rejection is taken by the Directorate and communicated to
the submitter no later than six months after the submission of the proposal. Rejections
are communicated to the submitter with reasons for rejection. The Directorate announces
the acceptance of proposals to DC-GENERAL and with a news item on the DCMI Web site. The
Application Profile is published as a Recommended Resource on the DCMI Web site.

### 5. Proposals for DCMI Process Documents

Examples: 
- DCMI By-laws,
- Procedure for approval of proposals by DCMI (this document)

Evaluation and subsequent acceptance or rejection of the proposal is at the discretion
of the Directorate, in consultation with the Advisory Board.

Decisions on acceptance or rejection are taken by the Directorate and communicated to
the submitter no later than two months after the submission of the proposal. Rejections
are communicated to the submitter with reasons for rejection. The Directorate announces
the acceptance of proposals to the DC-GENERAL and with a news item on the DCMI Web site.
The process document is published as a DCMI Process Document on the DCMI Web site.
