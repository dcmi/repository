<P>1.4 Review of January 2004 meeting, outstanding actions, and matters arising </P>
</B>
<P>The workshop secretary Leif Andresen presented the minutes of January 2004 meeting including the list of Recommendations and Actions. He did not comment on completed actions that did not require clarification.</P>

<P>Action 14.1.2: The workshop secretary Leif Andresen to contact all members of 2003 and ask for their participation of the 2004 Workshop work according to the new contractual context for CEN/ISSS workshops.</P>
<I><P>Comment</I>: This action will be ongoing until summer.</P>

<P>Action 14.1.3: Management team (Robina Clayphan, Leif Andresen and Luc van den Berghe) to provide guidelines for declaration statements for contributions-in-kind and guidelines for reporting performance indicators.</P>
<I><P>Comment</I>:  Done with ISSS/WS-MMI-DC/096. Declarations of contributions in kind for CEN/ISSS Workshop on Metadata for Multimedia Information - Dublin Core. Work of 2004 from 23 February 2004. These guidelines for contributions in kind include what project team need to report according to performance indicators.</P>

<P>Action 14.1.4: Management to set up an administration system for contributions-in-kind and reporting performance indicators. The workshop secretary Leif Andresen to report regularly to project team members and at meetings.</P>
<I><P>Comment</I>: Status was reported at agenda item 9.2 and was done at that time.</P>
<I>
</I><P>Action 14.2.2: Makx Dekkers to prepare a special session at the September meeting on the subjects of work item 3: Guidance for the deployment of Dublin Core Metadata in corporate environments.</P>
<I><P>Comment</I>: This action was an ongoing action and was discussed at agenda item 5.</P>

<P>Action 14.2.3:<I> </I>Leif Andresen to include an agenda item at the April meeting about session for external presentation of results at the December meeting.</P>
<I><P>Comment</I>: The action was done with adding a new agenda item 11.0.</P>

<P>The workshop members had no other comments and the minutes of January 2004 meeting were approved.</P>

<P>Robina Clayphan reported a reply from <I>ISO TC211 Geographic information/Geomatics</I> about liaison between this committee and MMI-DC. It is not normal procedure to establish liaison between ISO and CEN Technical Committees. But ISO TC211 invited MMI-DC to participate in their work and to nominate a contact person. The workshop members accepted the inivitation and Robina Clayphan suggested Martin Ford to be the contact. Martin Ford agreed to be the contact person.</P>

<P>In addition Robina Clayphan reported proposals from Paul Smits and Martin Ford about liaison with CEN TC 287 Geographic Information. The workshop members agreed to propose CEN TV 287 to establish a contact between MMI-DC and this committee. Robina Clayphan suggested Martin Ford to be the contact. Martin Ford agreed to be the contact person.</P>

<I><P>Recommendation 15.1</I>: The workshop members confirmed Martin Ford as the liaison to ISO TC 211 and CEN TC287.</P>
<P>Action 15.1.1: Robina Clayphan to inform ISO TC211 about Martin Ford as MMI-DC contact person.</P>
<P>Action 15.1.2: Martin Ford to inform Robina Clayphan about official contact to CEN TC287.</P>
<P>Action 15.1.3: Robina Clayphan to inform CEN TC287 about Martin Ford as MMI-DC contact person.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>2. Maintenance of existing CWAs&#9;</P>
</B>
<P>Introduction in the agenda: </P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>In 2003 the workshop produced several CEN Workshop Agreements. For some of these CWA’s we have received comments and others are out of synchronization with ISO-standards. Martin Ford has asked for a discussion about how and when to update CWA’s. A CEN Workshop Agreement has a three-year lifecycle: after three years a CWA must be withdrawn, revised or confirmed.</P>
</FONT>
<P>Martin Ford saw a real need for changing references to the final standard ISO19115 and as a consequence to update three CWA’s:</P>

<UL>
<LI>CWA 14856 - Guidance material for mapping between Dublin Core and ISO in the Geographic Information domain  </LI>
<LI>CWA 14857 - Mapping between Dublin Core and IS 19115, "Geographic Information - Metadata"    </LI>
<LI>CWA 14858 - Dublin Core Spatial Application Profile</LI></UL>


<P>Thomas Baker gave the information that DCMI Usage Board had two minor requests for changes of CWA 14855. The workshop members agreed to these updates.</P>

<P>The method to describe proposals for change to CWA’s was discussed. A new document would be the most satisfactory way, but the workshop members accepted a document with description of &quot;before and after&quot; as a sufficient way to propose a change of a CEN Workshop Agreement.</P>

<I><P>Recommendation 15.2</I>: The workshop members accepted offers from Martin Ford and Thomas Baker voluntarily to update CWAs. Martin Ford to update CWA 14856, 14857, and 14858 – and Thomas Baker CWA 14855.</P>
<P>Action 15.2.1: Martin Ford to submit proposals for update of CWA 14856, 14857, and 14858 before 1 September 2003. </P>
<P>Action 15.2.2: Members of the workshop to send comments to the proposals in 2 weeks.</P>
<P>Action 15.2.3: Leif Andresen to include an agenda item on September 2004 MMI-DC meeting with confirmation of revision of CWA 14856, 14857, and 14858.</P>
<P>Action 15.2.4: Thomas Baker to submit proposals for update of CWA 14855 before 1 September 2003. </P>
<P>Action 15.2.5: Members of the workshop to send comments to the proposal in two weeks.</P>
<P>Action 15.2.6: Leif Andresen to include an agenda item on September 2004 MMI-DC meeting with confirmation of revision of CWA 14855.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>3. Work item 5: Investigation of metadata issues and approaches in the area of accessibility and multilingual information</P>
</B><P>Project team: Liddy Nevile and Martin Ford Consultancy</P>

<P>Introduction in the agenda:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Metadata for Accessibility is a highly popular topic that has to be addressed. The vision of the Special Workshop has created much interest and following. This project hopes to bring about the need for CWAs in Metadata accessibility acting as a conduit for other organizations work. Work Item 5 has rescheduled its end time to July 2004 and will deliver a report of what is happening in the world of metadata accessibility and what needs to be done.</P>

Finally, comments of the community on last year's CWAs on Dublin Core Metadata for e-government and future actions. Our plan is to finalise the Table of Contents of the two CWAs taking into account the comments of the audience. To prepare for discussion, meeting participants should be ready to present their experiences from relevant national and international initiatives and projects. Information on e-government Metadata Frameworks and Deployment Guidelines are particularly welcome.</P>

<B><P>8. Proposals for MMI-DC work in 2005</P>
</B>
<P>Luc van den Berghe reported about a proposal on environmental metadata that was submitted in February – and the Commision had accepted it. The proposal is now subject for discussions between CEN and EU. </P>

<P>Robina Clayphan asked if the new proposals would effect at this year’s business plan. Luc van den Berghe didn’t think it would need to be changed. The discussed proposals have to be sent to the EU Commision15 September 2004, which is the next deadline for CEN to submit prosals.</P>

<UL>
<LI>persistent identifiers</LI>
<LI>follow-up Work Item 2</LI>
<LI>follow-up Work Item 3</LI>
<LI>vocabularies, thesauri, and ontologies</LI>
<LI>generic functional requirements for tools to create and maintain metadata</LI>
<LI>cross-domain searching</LI></UL>


<P>The proposals were discussed and members to write and submit proposals were agreed as described in following actions.</P>

<P>Martin Ford informed that he would send another proposal after the meeting.</P>

<P>9.1 Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</P>
</B>
<P>Makx Dekkers, Managing Director DCMI reported.</P>

<P>Makx Dekkers refered to Status DCMI September 2003 - March 2004, which was published a few weeks before the meeting:</P>
<P><A HREF="http://dublincore.org/news/communications/statusreport-200403.shtml">http://dublincore.org/news/communications/statusreport-200403.shtml</A></P>

<P>Makx Dekkers highligted:</P>

<P>The Library Application Profile will be updated in conformance with the CEN/ISSS Dublin Core Application Profile Guidelines (CWA 14855). </P>

<P>For DC-2004 are now two keynote speakers: by Zhang Xiaolin of the Chinese Academy of Science and Eric Miller of the World-wide Web Consortium.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>9.2 Contributions in kind and performance indicators for MMI-DC</P>
</B>
<P>The management team reported on status for contributions in kind and performance indicators for the workshop.</P>

<P>Luc distributed the form for contribution in kind (period 1-1-2004 to 30-4-2004) and asked member to fax the form to him.</P>

<P>Leif Andresen had collected information about expected mandays as contributions in kind from the five project teams. The forecast summed up to about 500 mandays, which is more than needed. Martin Ford asked whether we could have too many man-days. Luc van den Berghe said the answer was clearly &quot;no&quot;.</P>

<P>Leif Andresen presented the roadmap for performance indicators for 2004 and remarked that nearly all the collection of information to produce the performance indicators for 2004 will be work for CEN Workshop Management and for for MMI-DC Workshop Secretariat.</P>

<P>Luc van den Berghe underlined that next years workshop will have to meet the goals specified as performance indicators unlike this year where they are just reported for information. </P>

<B><P>Special session: Metadata for Accessibility Workshop</P>
</B><P>Schduled: 9:15-4:30 Friday 30th April 2004</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Special session of MMI-DC on accessibility was held with thirty international experts from the field of accessibility attending. The focus of the Workshop was to arrive at scenarios of current situations in this field in order to develop a plan for further work. Participants spent time thinking about what accessibility metadata needs they could identify in their experience and what solutions they were aware of that might help solve their, or others' problems. The process involved some presentations and the development of scenarios that represented problems. An open-ended list of issues was created.</P>

<P>It was clear from the meeting that there has been a lot of work done to develop technologies and techniques for making accessible resources and services. Participants were challenged to think about the role of metadata in the situation where, as is the case currently, most resources and services are not accessible but people are nevertheless required to function as so try to use them. </P>

<P>The Workshop participants worked through an agenda that had them refining problems and issues. </P>

<P>Presentations at the special session 30 April 2004:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Creating and Using Metadata to Manage Content Accessibility Auditing / Liddy Neville</LI>
<LI>Semantic Technology / Lisa Seeman (presented by Liddy Neville)</LI>
<LI>The Right Match / Jutta Treviranus</LI></UL>

<P>Participants had delivered pre-seminar statements as input to the discussion in beforehand:</P>

<UL>
<LI>ASCii's short paper / Regine Lambrecht and Bart Simons, ASCii </LI>
<LI>Accessibility and the publishing world / D. Fuschi, A.M.Luccini, F.Cardinali - GIUNTI Interactive Labs</LI>
<LI>Metadata for improving deaf people's web accessibility / Inmaculada Fajardo Bravo, Laboratory of Human Computer Interaction for Special Needs (LIPCNE)</LI>
<LI>Accessibility Metadata in the United States / WHO IS AUTHOR</LI>
<LI>Accessibility Metadata: Matching the Needs of the Learner / Jutta Treviranus. The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre</LI>
<LI>Accessible Meta Tags: using the correct parameters for accessible information processing / Lenoir, Crombie &amp; McKenzie, FNB</LI></UL>


<P>The content of the many documents has been analyzed and summarized in the main report. The first documents collected were pre-seminar statements from participants explaining their interest in a seminar on accessibility metadata. These were followed by small group definitions of people who might need to be considered. Following this, participants developed comprehensive scenarios and considered the issues they raised. Finally they considered possible solutions, available and being developed, and outstanding issues.</P>

<P>A specific problem for people when thinking about accessibility is to separate the role of those who develop the technologies and techniques from that of the metadata. Another was associated with the advances being made in the field of metadata, particularly the use of metadata in what is known as the 'Semantic Web'. Machine readable and usable information is the distinguishing feature of Semantic Web work that increases the need for standardization of ways of describing people's needs and resources and services. </P>

<P>In addition, it is often hard to distinguish between needs with respect to digital resources and services and physical objects and contexts. Conventionally, metadata is used to describe digital objects and the familiar model of description for physical resources, such as books, is carried across to the field of description of digital objects. Many digital objects, however, are closely linked to physical ones. </P>

<P>The special session gave an important input to MMI-DC Work Item 5 (2004) -  A report identifying metadata issues enabling support for accessibility and multilingualism.</P>
