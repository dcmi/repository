Not a day goes by that I don't miss Mailbase -- and I said as
much to the JISC representative (and conference co-sponsor)
in Geneva.  Of course, I wrapped this with grateful thanks
for JISCMAIL, such as it is.  Fortunately, he was a very good
friend of the former Mailbase designers and fully agreed.
I guess JISCMAIL has another two years or so before it comes
up for review.

I have no trouble accessing the AB archives.

Harry, Lance,

I have attached an MBOX file of early traffic on the dc-international
list -- both on the temporary one hosted at AIT in Thailand and the 
new Mailbase list.  Please add these to the archive and let me know the
URL.  Also, please let me know if there are any gaps between the end of
this archive and the beginning of dc-international postings that are 
already archived at http://dublincore.org.  I remember alerting Paul
Miller that Mailbase had deleted some early mail, and I vaguely recall
that he tried or maybe actually did succeed in recuperating some of
those early archives.  It is possible that these attached postings are
the ones he sent.  At any rate, if there are gaps, I could go back and
check this - but will not unless I know there is a gap...

Thanks,
Tom

Dear all,

It just came to my attention that the mailing list
dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th has been broken -- as near as we can tell
from the log files, since mid-December.

So here is the message I thought you all had already received.

Cheers,

Subject: DC in Multiple Languages list

Dear members of the mailing list

	Dublin Core in Multiple Languages (dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th):


This list has been quiet lately, but I have seen almost all of you
face to face over the past few weeks -- in Helsinki (at DC5), Osnabrueck
(the German metadata workshop), Tsukuba (ISDL97), or in Bangkok
(Laszlo Kovacs was here).

What has emerged is a plan to link versions of DC-Simple in different
languages -- just the fifteen basic elements -- into a simple distributed
registry.  This registry would use a Resource Description Framework
capability to _inherit_ the fifteen machine-readable indexing tokens (like
"DC.Creator") from a central source and _override_ human-readable text
locally with labels and descriptions in Thai, Japanese, and Portuguese
(see http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~tbaker/registry.gif).  Most browsers are not
normally configured for Japanese and Thai, so we may use a multilingual
browser applet developed at the University of Library and Information
Science in Tsukuba for displaying the proper fonts on browsers enabled
for Java (see http://mhtml.ulis.ac.jp).

Aside from English and Thai, this simple registry could include Japanese
(Shigeo Sugimoto), German (Diann Rusch-Feja), Hungarian (Laszlo Kovacs),
and Portuguese (Jose Borbinha).  I know of translations of DC-Simple into
Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish, and I know there is interest
in French.  Most recently, I had a strong expression of interest for a
DC in Tibetan for use by monks scanning manuscripts for a repository of
Buddhist texts on the Web.

Who out there is interested in participating in this experiment?  Alpha
users willing to help solve the technical problems are especially welcome.

Cheers,
Tom

Dear members of the mailing list dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th,

This mailing list on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages has been quiet
for awhile, but that is about to change.  

Over the past few months, I have seen almost all of you face-to-face at
various conferences and workshops.  A plan has emerged to set up a
distributed registry of DC-Simple in multiple languages.  A few of us
met two weeks ago in Germany to discuss this, and I am writing the
report, which I will soon submit to you all for discussion.

In the meantime, I have responded to two relevant postings that
appeared yesterday on the DC User Guide list (see below).  Watch
this space for a draft report within the next week or so.

Cheers,
Tom

---------------------
Charo, Yves,

Your postings on Dublin Core in French and Spanish are very timely
because there is a Working Group on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages,
it met in Germany on May 25, and I am about to release a draft report
of its conclusions and plans.

Now that the Resource Description Framework Working Group of W3C has
defined a machine-readable way to express metadata schemas and relate
them to each other, we are planning to use RDF to link versions of the
Dublin Core in multiple languages into a distributed registry.  The
likely participants in this first round are versions in English,
French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, the Nordic languages
(Finnish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Swedish, Danish), Thai, and
Indonesian.

Notice that one of these is French
(http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~vercoust/DOCS/DC-french.html); I am not
aware of any versions yet in Spanish.

We consider this to be a time of experimentation and encourage people
to make new versions in various languages -- even if it may result in
there being more than one version for any particular language.  We
expect that some versions eventually will move onto stable servers at
institutions dedicated to maintaining them for the long term.  And the
Dublin Core community may sooner or later develop a system for
submitting these versions to peer review of scientific quality and
institutional commitment, in order to confer on some an official stamp
of approval.

For now, however, we believe it is best not to stifle initiative with
too many obstacles and requirements -- even if we could.  The more
people use and promote DC in multiple languages, the more it will
spread the word and ultimately help us interoperate better at a
semantic level.  I agree with Yves that being multilingual and
multicultural is a great purpose for DC.

Let me know if you would like to join the mailing list
dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th, which is about to discuss the draft
report that I have almost finished.  This is an inclusive,
consensus-building process, so please feel free to join in.

Cheers,
Tom

Dear members of the dc-international mailing list,

The Working Group on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages now has a
Web page:

	http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~tbaker/DC-Multilingual.html

I would like to open discussion of a position paper, appended below (and
archived at the Web site).  Henceforth, our discussion will be archived
at http://dlforum.external.forth.gr/dcm, so we will be able to cite URLs
for previous email.

Cheers,
Tom

---------

                    DC-Multilingual: plans for a
                 distributed registry of Dublin Core
                      in multiple languages


                         Working Group on
                  Dublin Core in Multiple Languages



Version: Monday, 22 June 1998

This position paper grew out of discussion at a meeting of the
Working Group on 25 May 1998 at the German National Research
Center for Information Technology in Bonn, Germany. [GMD]  It
will evolve through discussion.  Please direct comments to the
mailing list dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th, which is archived at
http://dlforum.external.forth.gr/dcm.

The Working Group on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages takes the
following position:

    1. The reference language of the international Dublin Core
    community is English inasmuch all of its outputs are discussed
    and approved in English.  Accordingly, the English version of
    the Dublin Core has a special status as the canonical result of
    an international process.

    2. However, the semantics of Dublin Core elements are in
    principle expressible equally well in any modern language.
    We hesitate to call versions of the Dublin Core in languages
    other than English "translations."  Rather, these versions could
    function as reference definitions in their own right, as objects
    of discussion, adaptation, and extension in locally specific ways.
    Like any good translation, moreover, such versions need not be
    word-for-word literal as long as they convey the essence of the
    canonical definitions in ways that make sense to their readers.

    3. People currently associate "the Dublin Core" with a standard
    in English.  We would like to call the sum of instantiations
    of the Dublin Core in various languages "Multilingual Dublin
    Core," or "DC-Multilingual."  One might think of the metadata
    semantics shared within DC-Multilingual to be, in some sense,
    independent of any particular language, hence universal.

    4. The versions of Dublin Core elements in various
    languages should share a single namespace.  As of May
    1998, one likely candidate for the namespace name is
    "http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements."  This will need to
    be discussed and ratified by the Dublin Core community as a whole.

    5. As defined in the RFC for Simple Dublin Core [RFC], Dublin Core
    elements consist of a descriptive name (eg, "Author or Creator"),
    a single-word label or "token" for use in encoding schemes (eg,
    "Creator"), and element definitions.  The descriptive names and
    element definitions are meant to be read primarily by humans,
    the tokens primarily by machines.  The tokens look like English
    words but stand for universal elements.  Universal elements can
    have interchangeable names and definitions in multiple languages.

    6. A version of the Dublin Core in French (DC-French) at
    http://www.inria.fr could have universal elements -- canonical
    elements with translated definitions and names -- and elements that
    are specific to DC-French.  Universal elements would use the Dublin
    Core namespace (here, http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements),
    while local elements would use a namespace such as
    http://www.inria.fr/metadata/dublin_core_elements.  In the RDF schema
    of DC-French at http://www.inria.fr, then, the definition of the
    Title element would look like this (minus accents, unfortunately):

    <RDF:Description
        RDF:href="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#Title">
       <RDF:instanceOf
        RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Syntax#PropertyType"/>
       <RDFS:necessity
        RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Schema#ZeroOrMore"/>
       <RDFS:Comment xml:lang="fr">Le nom donne a la ressource par le
       createur ou l'auteur.</RDFS:Comment>
    </RDF:Description>

    7. Dublin Core elements have a human-readable descriptive name,
    a machine-readable label (token), and human-readable definitions.
    However, as of May 1998, the Resource Description Framework
    Schema Core supports only the latter two -- the token and the
    definition. [RDF]  For describing the Dublin Core in English, this
    does not pose a big problem, as the token is almost identical to the
    name (eg, "Creator" versus "Author or Creator").  To express schemas
    in other languages, however, we need support for human-readable
    descriptive names as well.  If the RDF specification will not
    support this in the Schema Core, perhaps the Dublin Core community
    should define its own extension to RDF (a new "property type," in
    RDF jargon), which could be maintained within the official Dublin
    Core name space.

    8. A description of a document using Simple Dublin Core and RDF
    syntax would look like the following, independently of whether
    the creator of that description had referred to DC-English,
    DC-French, or DC-Thai, and regardless of the language of the
    document itself (in this case German):

    <?xml:namespace ns="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements"
    prefix="DC"?>
    <RDF:RDF>
      <RDF:Description RDF:HREF="http://www.biblio.de/buecher/kleist.html">
        <DC:Title XML:lang="de">Das Erdbeben in Chili</DC:Title>
        <DC:Creator>Heinrich von Kleist</DC:Creator>
      </RDF:Description>
    </RDF:RDF>

    9. It is not clear whether machine-readable RDF schemas should
    be embedded in human-readable HTML documentation files or
    kept separate.  For now we will keep these separate so that we
    more easily can change them when we know what is required.

    10.  It is not clear whether the namespace name (see #4 above) should
    point to an RDF schema file or to a Web page in HTML.  Perhaps element
    definitions could be dynamically extracted from an RDF file to an HTML
    file, or vice versa.  Moreover, the draft XML Namespaces specification
    [XML] makes a distinction between a namespace name and an optional
    URI that points to a schema.  This is clearly a question for further
    research.  Either way, what the namespace name points to can change
    over time, so we can go ahead and write metadata with confidence.

    11. Versions of the Dublin Core in other languages should cite
    the specific English version on which they are based (eg, 1.0,
    1.1, 2.0...), as that canonical version will evolve over time.
    For example, the Dublin Core could grow to have more than fifteen
    elements.  Perhaps one could give each new version its own URI.
    Exactly how versioning should be implemented is a question for the
    Dublin Core community as a whole.

    12. Links from the central namespace server to versions in other
    languages should be machine-parsable.  It should be possible
    for users to transmit a preference for Finnish, get the URI for
    DC-Finnish in return, and henceforth load Dublin Core element
    names and definitions from Helsinki.

    13. We are embarking on a period of experimentation, during which we
    should invite metadata-using institutions in many countries to create
    versions of Dublin Core in various languages.  Regional language or
    institutional differences may occasionally result in the creation of
    multiple versions of Dublin Core in any given language, but we see
    no reason to place restrictions on this at present.  Eventually we
    may need a process for evaluating such versions, with peer review
    for quality and some verification of an institution's commitment to
    maintaining a version in the long term.  Versions that pass could be
    "certified" by the Dublin Core community as a whole.

    14. DC-Multilingual should be a forum for sharing and negotiating
    metadata semantics across languages.  An extension originally
    defined in Thailand could be incorporated into the universal
    version and be used worldwide.

Process and deliverables

    15. The distributed registry should start with versions of Simple
    Dublin Core in multiple languages.  Sub-elements should not be
    implemented before the Dublin Core community ratifies versions
    of Complex Dublin Core.

    16. DC-Multilingual should comply with the RDF specifications
    as they evolve.  Indeed, it could provide RDF with a
    model application that is high-profile, international, and
    vendor-neutral.  The DC-Multilingual community, in turn, should
    communicate its evolving requirements back to the RDF Working
    Group for consideration in future versions of RDF.

    17. The distributed registry of DC-Multilingual will be implemented
    by the Working Group on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages in close
    consultation with Dublin Core advisory committees, the RDF Working
    Group, and the Dublin Core community as a whole (as represented by the
    periodic workshops and by the meta2 mailing list).  The Working Group
    will maintain a Web page at http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core and
    conduct discussions on the mailing list dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th,
    which is archived at http://dlforum.external.forth.gr/dcm.

    18. Local implementors are strongly encouraged to develop projects
    that enhance or extend the capabilities of the registry.  In addition
    to schemas, such sites could eventually hold downloadable templates,
    metadata editors, Java utilities, user guides, enumerated lists,
    crosswalks to other element sets, and controlled vocabularies.

Dear DC-international members,

First of all I would like to introduce myself. My name is Hachim
Haddouti, I am working in FORWISS (Bavaria Research Center For
Knowledge-Based Systems) at Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany.
My research areas include: DBMS, Multilingual IR, Digital Libraries and
Web.

> 	http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~tbaker/DC-Multilingual.html

Secondly I would like to thank Tom for creating and organising this
forum which  will with our discussions, contributions,
suggestions, critics, etc. yield best and fruitful results.

Tom, let me please the following correction to the position paper:

>     http://www.inria.fr/metadata/dublin_core_elements.

error 404!! The URL is wrong.

I will try to convince some Arabic-speaking researcher to arabize DC
and introduce it in the Arabic market.
But I would like to know the feedback of who have translated and
implemented the
DC in other languages in order to know the consumed time and the 
resources.

Best regards,

Hachim

The question of internationalisation came up at the
meeting last week, in connection with the provision of
descriptions in different languages for the items in a
controlled vocabulary.

I mentioned that I had written a note in April to a few
people involved in RDF and DC, and I agreed to forward it to
the DC Data Model list.  This became action number 6 in Stu's
list:

>6.	Charles will forward a series of limited distribution mail
>concerning DC-I18N to DC-DMWG.

I am also sending a copy to the DC International list, as
the topic is relevant, but please follow up to the DC Data
Model list only.
See http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-datamodel/ for how to join
that list, or mail Misha Wolf (misha.wolf@reuters.com).

For the benefit of those who have already seen this mail, I have
not made any changes, so that they don't have to read it again.
I have just removed the references to the weather.

The only reply I received was from Renato Ianella, but I am not
including it here as I don't have his permission.
Renato -- do forward your message if you think it is relevant.

On re-reading the mail below, I think most of what I wrote still
stands, but I would add one thing: I have not used the RDF Alt
construct, because it is not possible to add properties onto a
single Alt list from two different RDF documents (eg two
documents in different languages).  You *can* add properties onto
a single node that is not an Alt.

=======================================================
Message from 15 April:

The question of the internationalization of Dublin Core
came up a couple of weeks ago when Misha and I were
talking to Eric on the phone.  I had some ideas, and
Misha asked me to write them down.

The question is how we construct schemas for DC suitable
for use by people from anywhere in the world.  The
single-word label obviously does not change.  The full
name of the element, its description, and any other helpful
text needs to be translated.  We need to decide how this
should be packaged so that the user gets presented with
the right version, but the versions must still be easy to
maintain.

I am torn between two approaches.  With Misha not here,
and no-one to discuss them with, I have decided to present
both of them as a starting point.

I have in mind a situation where a user is using a general-
purpose metadata editor.  When I say "general-purpose", I
mean not dedicated to the Dublin Core element set, but
configured by RDF schemas to be able to be used for editing
metadata that uses any vocabulary.

I think there is no objection to defining new RDF property
types for the use of such editors.  The main problem here
is knowing what namespace to use, because the name will
typically depend on which consortium defines these property
types.  For the moment I will use the namespace "XXX".

I am trying to use "locale" and not "language".  These are
easily confused.  The codes used are very similar,
eg the RFC 1766 language "en-GB" is often used in places where
the locale is set to "en_GB" (my best reference for use of the
underbar in locales is the POSIX standard ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993,
but I don't have a copy myself).

==========================================================

Approach number 1

In this approach, we bundle together all the definitions for
a particular locale in a single RDF file, say elements_en_US.rdf.

[This is modelled on the way Java properties are handled:
I try never to invent anything myself.
<http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/>
It is also how Reggie does it of course, but using directory
names I think.]

So the file elements_fr.rdf may contain:

<RDF:Description RDF:href="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core#Title">
  <RDF:instanceOf RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Syntax#PropertyType"/>
  <RDFS:necessity RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Schema#ZeroOrMore"/>
  <RDFS:Comment xml:lang="fr">Le nom donn&eacute; &agrave; la ressource par
    le cr&eacute;ateur ou l'auteur.</RDFS:Comment>
  <XXX:name xml:lang="fr">Titre</XXX:name>
</RDF:Description>
etc

The editor would somehow selectively load the correct RDF files
into its memory, so that the entry "Titre" appears on the drop-
down list of possible property types, but not "Title".
And when this property type is selected, the French help text
appears, and not the English.

This selective loading could be done by providing another
file containing this:

<RDF:Description ID="DCSelection">
  <XXX:LocaleOption>
    <RDF:Description>
      <XXX:Locale>fr</XXX:Locale>
      <XXX:DefFile>elements_fr.rdf</XXX:DefFile>
    </RDF:Description>
  </XXX:LocaleOption>

  <XXX:LocaleOption>
    <RDF:Description>
      <XXX:Locale>de</XXX:Locale>
      <XXX:DefFile>elements_de.rdf</XXX:DefFile>
    </RDF:Description>
  </XXX:LocaleOption>

  <XXX:LocaleOption>
    <RDF:Description>
      <XXX:Locale></XXX:Locale>
      <XXX:DefFile>elements_en.rdf</XXX:DefFile>
    </RDF:Description>
  </XXX:LocaleOption>
etc
</RDF:Description>

Note that the last one has a zero-length string for its locale.
The editor would be programmed to look down this list to find
the longest string which prefix-matches the user's current locale.
Thus the English one would be chosen if the user's locale is
not supported yet.  Thus "fr_CH" would pick "fr", and "zh_TW"
would pick "" (the English one).

In Java, there is no list of files like this.  The resource
loader just manipulates file names, looking successively for
"elements_fr_CH.properties"
"elements_fr.properties"
"elements.properties"
(it's actually a bit more complicated, but you get the idea)

On the other hand, it might be better if the files themselves
contain information about what they are good for, more like a
Java Bean.  One would put this at the top of the French file:

<RDF:Description ID="FileInfo">
  <XXX:Locale>fr</XXX:Locale>
</RDF:Description>

Once such a file has been introduced to the system (a bit like
registering a Microsoft COM object), selecting one would be
done by standard searching ("find me a file which defines
properties of resources of type "PropertyType" and contains
a resource called "FileInfo" whose "XXX:Locale" is "fr"").
The user would have a Preferences dialog where he or she
could choose between "show all properties" and "show
properties in local language only".

==========================================================

Approach number 2

In this approach, we put the locale selection right down among
the data.

Any file could contain:

<RDF:Description RDF:href="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core#Title">
  <RDF:instanceOf RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Syntax#PropertyType"/>
  <RDFS:necessity RDF:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-RDF-Schema#ZeroOrMore"/>
  <RDFS:Comment>
    <RDF:Description>
      <XXX:Locale>fr</XXX:Locale>
      <RDF:Value xml:lang="fr">Le nom donn&eacute; &agrave; la ressource par
        le cr&eacute;ateur ou l'auteur.</<RDF:Value>
    </RDF:Description>
  </RDFS:Comment>
  <XXX:name>
    <RDF:Description>
      <XXX:Locale>fr</XXX:Locale>
      <RDF:Value xml:lang="fr">Titre</<RDF:Value>
    </RDF:Description>
  </XXX:name>
  <RDFS:Comment>
    <RDF:Description>
      <XXX:Locale>en</XXX:Locale>
      <RDF:Value xml:lang="en">The name given to the resource, usually
        by the Creator or Publisher.</<RDF:Value>
    </RDF:Description>
  </RDFS:Comment>
  <XXX:name>
    <RDF:Description>
      <XXX:Locale>en</XXX:Locale>
      <RDF:Value xml:lang="en">Title</<RDF:Value>
    </RDF:Description>
  </XXX:name>
</RDF:Description>

All this data can then be stored away, with no record kept
of which file each property value came from.  On the user
interface, only the properties with the correct locale would
be displayed.  The effect to the user would be exactly the
same as Approach 1.

This sidesteps the complication of managing the different
files, but makes the data itself a bit more complicated.
The data is easier to manage, because you don't have to worry
about putting it in separate files.  It could be stored in
a database.

There is a temptation to just use the language markup, ie
leave out the "locale" tags, but I think this would be misusing
it.  We want to present to the user a package of data specially
prepared for that locale, not just all the strings that happen
to be in the user's preferred language.

In the position paper it says:

    7. Dublin Core elements have a human-readable descriptive name,
    a machine-readable label (token), and human-readable definitions.
    However, as of May 1998, the Resource Description Framework
    Schema Core supports only the latter two -- the token and the
    definition. [RDF] 

Status: RO

I actually think the lack of a human-readable descriptive name
in RDF Schema a significant ommission. Without it, it will be
difficult to promote the reuse of core metadata schemas
(like DC) to an international audience.

I said:

  In the func spec we put together:

    http://www.dstc.edu.au/RDU/RDF/rdf-schema-func.html

  our approach was that allow multiple languages for the
  human-readable bits of a schema AND the ability to 
  inherit a schema and 'add' new languages defns to
  some of the properties (see Example 2 in above url)

  I think this means, in Charles case, *both* Approach 1 and 2?

Yes.  I wonder if it would be best to make the namespace definition
point to a file containing the language-independent parts of the
schema *and* a pointer to a separate switch file.

When I say "file" I mean of course "URI".  And "file containing..."
means "URI which when dereferenced would return...".  It's just so
much easier to think in terms of files.

OK, I'll back down on this one.

What I meant was that one of the attractions of Approach 2 is that
it is easier to define and discuss it by drawing RDF nodes and arcs,
and you don't have to worry about "files".  But eventually you have
to deal with the files anyway, and then Approach 1 is better.

When Tom Baker brought this up, I told him he could just define
such property types in his own namespace.  The report from his
meeting last month indicates that the DC-in-Multiple-Languages
working group would prefer them blessed by the DC community.
*You* could define them in a namespace that you control.  That
will work just as well as if they were in a namespace controlled
by the W3C or OCLC.  In fact I think you and Renato are
particularly well placed to define property types for use with
general purpose metadata editors (I don't know if you are
working together, but you mentioned Reggie).  I don't think it
is really a Dublin Core matter, because the DC is just a
vocabulary for metadata about real resources.

You could also define the property types for the switch file.
The DC-in-Multiple-Languages group may make use of them (the
report mentioned experimental implementations) and tell you
of any difficulties.

Welcome, and many thanks for your feedback!  I notice you sent your
message to dc-international-request@cs.ait.ac.th, the command-line
address for subscribing and unsubscribing, so it did not reach everyone
at dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th (see my .signature below).

I meant that as a hypothetical URI of an RDF schema -- even if there
were a file at that address, it would not yet be formatted this way.
But I see your point.  Perhaps we should use the URL of a version that
already exists.

That would be great!  If they finish a version soon, perhaps they could
participate in the "first step" registry.  We want to use MHTML for
displaying Thai, Japanese, Chinese, and Greek on any Java-enabled browser
(see http://mhtml.ulis.ac.jp/).  The developers of MHTML keep adding
languages all the time, but of course Arabic has additional complexities
(right to left).  Are you aware of any such applications for displaying
Arabic on regular Web browsers without having to load extra fonts?
Or maybe you know someone who could add Arabic capability to MHTML?

What I hear is that it takes very little time to make that initial
translation -- a matter of hours.  It takes longer to discuss that
translation with colleagues and arrive at wordings that everyone likes.
What starts taking alot of time is the periodic revision as the English
version itself evolves.  Of course, if the maintainers of a version
start discussing local extensions, then that local version takes on
a life of its own and it becomes a major task.  We figure that some
organizations will want to venture down this path and others will not.
Just putting up a version in a certain language should initially take
almost no resources -- just a file or two on a Web server, and perhaps
some applets and a gateway if font support is needed.

Creators of other versions may want to comment?

Tom

There are two separate issues here: inheritance and URIs.

The ability to inherit definitions is a generally useful feature for
schemas. By inherit, I mean the ability to 'import' a schema definition
and over-ride specific productions within it to derive a new schema. It
allows you to say things like "The AusGILS schema is exactly the same
as Dublin Core with these additional one or two properties", or "The
French Dublin Core is exactly the same as Dublin Core, except the
human semantic information has been replaced with French text."

Importing and over-riding means that subsequent modifications to the
base schema are automatically propogated to the derived schemas. It also
makes explicit what has changed in the derived schema.

The disadvantage is that processing a derived schema requires the 
software to fetch multiple schema definition files. From experience I
know that fetching *one* schema file across the web noticeably slows
starting a metadata editor. Having to fetch several (possibly from
around the world) is not likely to be fast.

I would like to have inheritance, and plan to experiment with it (in
my copious free time :-), but whether it will be practical...

URIs. I was being quite deliberate in talking about files (i.e. URLs).
If URNs existed, we would not need a switch file. Instead we could
adopt the convention that derived schemas had URNs that were extensions
of the base schema.

For example, if the base URI was:

	urn://...location.../DublinCore

then the URI for the French version would be:

	urn://...location.../DublinCore/Fr-fr

The generation of the URN for the specific language version of Dublin
Core would be easy (and vice versa). Because URNs do not imply location,
there is no problem with decentralising management of the language
specific versions.

Even though URNs haven't taken off, taking this approach but with URLs
(or PURLs) might not be a bad thing. It is neat and clean, and leaves
open the chance that URNs might save us.

Unless I have misunderstood you, this is a *really* bad idea :-)
If the language dependent properties varied from schema to schema, it
would be almost impossible to write generic metadata software.

I'd be happy to work with Ren on this (or anyone else who is playing
with using schemas to configure software). However, I'm full time on
an intensive project at the moment and I don't have a lot of free time.
(Which is why I'm writing this on a Sunday :-(. I'm also not sure which

Dear all,

It would be nice if we could present a multilingual registry at the
next Dublin Core workshop, at the Library of Congress in November 1998.
It turns out that enough of us are going to be at a workshop on digital
libraries we are organizing at AIT for us to hold a meeting of the
Working Group about the next steps for implementation.

The International Joint Workshop on Digital Libraries (IJWDL'98) [1] will
be held on 7 to 9 September 1998 at the Asian Institute of Technology
in Bangkok, Thailand. This workshop is twelfth in a series that until
now has been held at the University of Library and Information Science
in Tsukuba, Japan.  Its sponsors are the Asian Institute of Technology,
Kasetsart University (Thailand), the Library Association of Thailand,
University of Library and Information Science, and National Center for
Science Information Systems (Japan).

The first two days of this event will consist of tutorials on basic
topics for Thai and Southeast Asian librarians and information providers.
This will be followed on Wednesday by the scientific workshop, which will
feature papers on multilinguality.  The meeting of the Working Group for
Dublin Core in Multiple Languages is scheduled for Sunday, 6 September,
at AIT.

If any of you would like to attend, please drop me a line.

Cheers,
Tom

I agree with all this.  It can go in the document (is there one?).

I hadn't thought this through.  I was just using URI instead of URL
in order not to rule out URNs, but what you say makes sense.

Sorry, I didn't explain enough.  What I mean is that Tom should define
such property types in his own namespace, but everyone in the world
should use them, for every schema, and no-one else should ever define
any property types with the same use.  The namespace mechanism means
that there is no need for any formal agreement to be reached before
everybody can start using them.  We just have to trust Tom not to change
the definition after we have started to use them.

I appreciate your contribution.  I *am* being paid to do this, but I
have only 7 more working days (total, not all on DC stuff) until I move
on to working on something quite different, not for Reuters.
Rich Townsend is taking over my job at Reuters, but it will take some
time for him to get up to speed.

Tom,

There seem to be no messages on the archive page.
There is a link inviting you to send email to a different
list (dcm-list@dlforum.external.forth.gr).

I am leaving Reuters soon, and my mail account will be closed,
so I will have to unsubscribe.  I like to unsubscribe in plenty
of time, as it sometimes takes a while to get the commands right,
so I thought I could follow any further discussions by looking
in the archive, but I can't see anything.

Thanks,

Charles     charles.wicksteed@reuters.com until July 10th

Andrew, Charles, 
members of DC Datamodel (DC-DMWG),
members of DC in Multiple Languages (DC-MLWG),

The current position paper of the DC-MLWG points out (see below) that we
need RDF support for human-readable labels.  Charles and Andrew of DC-DMWG
recently exchanged some email about this and related issues (below) and
cross-posted this to the DC-MLWG list.  I found this very helpful though
I recognize that posting in two lists is probably not good practice.
May I suggest that for now, discussion of the mechanics of RDF remain
on the DC-DMWG list, which I would encourage members of DC-MLWG to join.

In the meantime, I would be grateful if someone (Charles suggests Andrew)
would define and post the property types we need to support schemas in
multiple languages (and the switch files mentioned below).  My sense is
that the need for a "human-readable label," whatever it may be called,
is something everyone agrees on and could be done very quickly.

Charles will be wrapping up his work at Reuters any day now and moving
on to other projects.  I would like to take the opportunity once again
to thank him for his contributions to this discussion and to wish him
all the best.

Tom

A few announcements:

    -- There is a new Chinese version of DC on the Web page 
       (see the URL in my signature).  Versions in Korean and
       Indonesian are done but are not yet posted on the Web.

    -- Some Asian members of the Working Group held a meeting
       at the Asian Institute of Technology on 6 September, at
       which Tom Baker and Xu Bo presented a prototype interface
       for displaying versions of DC in various fonts (using MHTML)
       and a starting-point architecture for a distributed registry.
       I will post the meeting notes when I return from Crete.

    -- Several of you will attend the Second Euroconference on
       Digital Libraries in Crete, and we would like to organize
       a meeting and/or dinner for anyone interested in the
       Working Group.  Please send me email or track me down at
       the conference.  I will arrive on Saturday afternoon and am
       staying at the Knossos Royal Village Hotel.

As you know I will attend the conference and please count with my
attendance in your meeting.
Because of the overbooked  Knossos Hotel I will stay in Chrissi
Ammoudia Hotel.

Dear *,

first of all it was very nice to meet some of you in Crete. This
strengths the motiviation to work together.

As I mentioned there, here
http://www.forwiss.tu-muenchen.de/~haddouti/DC_arabic.html
you can access the Arabic version (translation) of DC. Any comments are
welcomed, in particular to the translation:-).

regards,

Hachim

PS: Tom, would you please provide me with the Chinese version (if
applicable) to my China travel.

Dear *,

according to the comments of Anne-Marie (thanks) I converted the PS
file of the Arabic-DC to PDF. Thus, now there are two versions: PDF and
PS file, beside the HTML versions. So I hope that every one in the
digital earth can display the Arabic-DC.

Regards,
Hachim

I went through the RDF schema proposal, and the example for DC.
It means now it is very easy (standard) to write:

<rdf:RDF
     xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#"
     xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-schema#">

<rdf:Description ID="Title">
    <rdf:instanceOf
rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#PropertyType"/>
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Title</rdfs:label>        
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
          The name given to the resource, usually by the Creator or Publisher.
    </rdfs:comment>
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="fr">Titre</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="fr">
          Le nom donn  la ressource par le crateur ou l'auteur.
</rdfs:comment>
  </rdf:Description>

etc.

How ever putting the locale definition in the reference definition is not
what we want (see Charles Wicksteed and all.' mails). We wante local
definitions such as:

<rdf:RDF
     xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax#"
     xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-schema#">
     xmlns:rdfs="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core">

<rdf:Description about="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core#Title">
     <rdfs:label xml:lang="fr"> Titre </rdfs:label>
     <rdfs:comment xml:lang="fr">
          Le nom donn  la ressource par le crateur ou l'auteur.   
     </rdfs:comment>
</rdf:Description>

etc..

And use a switch file to select the various locale descriptions as Approach
1 in Charles's mail.

I hope RDF schemas allows for extending schema this way, since we do not
need (nor want) to use RDFS:subClassOf  here.

What do you think?

Dear all,

Four weeks have passed since 19 of the members of this list (and
16 observers) met in Crete.  Since then, I was in Brussels, where we
presented a summary report of the Joint NSF-EU Working Groups on Digital
Libraries Research, in which several members of this list have been
involved.  Then I was in Kunming, China, for something quite unrelated,
but which delayed my work on our Web pages.  So on the eve of departure
for the Sixth Dublin Core Workshop in Washington, I have several things
to report:

1.  I have updated the page at 
    http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~tbaker/DC-Multilingual.html, adding links
    to several new versions of Dublin Core.  There is a parallel page
    for the working group at http://purl.org/dc.  I will clarify in 
    Washington how best to manage these.

2.  Please welcome to this mailing list:

    Gerda Schaaf (gerda@python.konbib.nl)
    Carol Peters (carol@iei.pi.cnr.it) 
    Michael Freeston (freeston@alexandria.ucsb.edu)
    Dan Brickley (daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk)
    Tetsuo Sakaguchi (saka@ulis.ac.jp)
    Catalin Varuara (cata@waic.ro) **
    Preben Hansen (preben@sics.se)
    Ingeborg Solvberg (ingeborg.solvberg@idi.ntnu.no)
    Hariklia Tsalapata (htsalapa@ics.forth.gr).
    Stefania Biagioni (biagioni@iei.pi.cnr.it)

    ** = Catalin Varuara of Romania was at the meeting in Crete,
    but her email address (as I interpreted her handwriting) seems
    to be wrong; can anybody help?

3.  In Washington, I will make a brief presentation about the
    Working Group on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages and about
    a prototype we developed at AIT that retrieves RDF-formatted
    schemas of Dublin Core from local servers in various countries
    and displays them with the proper fonts on Java-enabled browsers.
    Unfortunately Xu Bo, the graduate student who has worked with
    me on this, was denied a visa for the US and will thus be unable
    to attend.

4.  The following participants from non-English-speaking countries,
    or with an interest in registries or in multilinguality -- many
    of whom are on this mailing list -- will be at the DC6 workshop:

    Anders Ard, DTV / NetLab
    Anne-Marie Vercoustre, INRIA
    Choi, Han Suk, Korea Research Info Center
    Diann Rusch-Feja, Max Planck Institute for Human Development
    Jacques Ducloy, Laboratoire Lorrain de Recherche en Informatique

We have been  engaged in the traslation of D.C. definitions into Italian.
While making that translation, some remarks about  the original  English
definitions came out.  We list them below and would be very interested in
knowing the reactions of those who work in the field.

Any remark is included between arrows  and follows the piece of definition
[in particular the piece of text within asterisks] it refers to.

Maria Bruna Baldacci - Donatella Castelli

++++++++++++Comments ++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following is the reference definition of the Dublin Core Metadata
Element Set. The evolving reference description, including any defined
*qualifiers*, resides at.......

====>"qualifiers" are mentioned here, but do not appear in any other
definition, even though mentioning them in some element descriptions would
seem appropriate (e.g., in the definition of "source" and "relation")
<======

In the element descriptions below, each element has a descriptive name
intended to convey a common semantic understanding of the element, as well
as a *formal single-word label* intended to make ............

=====> Are  labels names to be used without quotation marks or with
quotation marks?
In the case of "without" we wonder why any  label name is included in
quotation marks.
In the case  of "with", we wonder why quotation marks do not appear in the
table where elements are classified. <====

...................
 ...................

8.   Resource Type      Label: "Type"

The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem, working
paper, technical report, essay, dictionary. For the sake of
interoperability, Type should be selected from an *enumerated list* that is
currently under development in the *workshop series.*

======> we would suggest that "enumerated list" be replaced by "authority
file" or "controlled list <=========

======> is  reference to "workshop series" correct? At the URL
http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core we see that information about evolving
controlled vocabularies and qualifiers appear under the section  "DC Open
Issues and Working Paper".
In any case, it should be specified that "workshop series" is a section at
that URL.
Obviously, our comments hold for any element description where "workshop
series" is mentioned.<==========


10.   Resource Identifier      Label: "Identifier"

A string or number used to uniquely identify the resource. Examples for
networked resources include URLs and URNs (when implemented). Other
globally-unique identifiers, such as International Standard Book Numbers
(ISBN) or other formal names are also candidates for this element.

=======> In the phrase above,   "other formal names" seems to be very
pleonastic, and we would cut it off from the Italian translation.<========

11.   Source      Label: "Source"

Information about a second resource from which the present resource is derived.
 While it is generally recommended that elements contain information about
the present resource only, this element may contain a date, creator,
format, identifier, or other metadata for the second resource when it is
considered important for discovery of the present resource; *recommended
best practice is to use the Relation element instead*.

=====>This seems to be a very strange definition as it says:
"this element may contain..., however do not use it"<====

For example, it is possible to use a Source date of 1603 in a description
of a 1996 film adaptation of a Shakespearean play, but it is preferred
instead to use Relation
"IsBasedOn" with a reference to a separate resource whose description
contains a Date of 1603. Source is not applicable if the present resource
is in its original form.

=======> The example above does not  seem to be the best one to clarify how
to use the Source element. Moreover, other official D.C. documents give
different semantics - and better examples also -  for that element [ see,
for example, "D.C Qualifiers/Substructure" by Rebecca Guenther]<====


13.   Relation             Label: "Relation"

An identifier of a second resource and its relationship to the present resource.

===> Are controlled qualifiers to be mentioned here?<====

This element permits links between related resources and resource
descriptions to be indicated.

======> The statement above is not clear to us. We have been unable to
understand which information does it add to the preceding one. <=======

 Examples include an edition of a work (IsVersionOf), ............
======> Here only examples of  relationships are given, whereas "relation"
is defined as  the pair "An identifier of a second resource and its
relationship to the present resource". In our opinion,  it should be
specified what kind of examples are those which follow.

Dear members of the dc-international list,

As many of you have read on meta2, DC6 was a momentous workshop for
Dublin Core.  For those of you who do not subscribe to meta2, I have
attached Stu's excellent summary below.  Some news:

1. My report on the activities of the Working Group on DC in
Multiple Languages was well-received and -- exceptionally for DC6 --
uncontroversial.

2. At AIT, we have finished a prototype distributed registry with versions
of Dublin Core in many languages formatted in RDF.  Before putting this
online over the coming weeks, we will be in touch with many of you about
URIs for these files on your Web sites.

3. The Dublin Core Initiative is adopting more formal procedures for
reporting and archiving the activities of its working groups.  The Web
page I maintain at the URL below has "half-migrated" to OCLC, but we still
need to work out a procedure for handling the work-flow through email.
I realize that some documents are out of sync and will give this my full
attention after December 15.

4. Most pressingly (for me), I am writing an article on Dublin Core
in Multiple Languages for the December 15 issue of D-Lib Magazine and
have been in touch with many of you this past week requesting related
information and URLs.  I will send you all some mail soon asking for
your advice and comments on aspects of the draft.

The Dublin Core community clearly sees our work as important, and a
number of us are strongly committed to moving forward on the agenda we
have described in our position paper.  I look forward over the coming
weeks to reopening discussion of the position paper in light of the
developments that that began in Washington.

Best regards,
Tom

Subject: Summary of the Dublin Core workplan for the coming year
Date: Thu, 12 Nov 1998 09:19:53 -0500

The following outline summarizes the program of work the DC Community has
ahead of it for the coming year. A more detailed treatment will be reflected
in the DC-6 Workshop Report.  

I. DC Process

Establishing a formal process for maintenance and evolution of the Dublin
Core is a central requirement for continued progress.  The Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative needs a coherent process that makes it clear how we do
our work, how change is initiated and ratified (or not), and a clear record
of that change.   The beginnings of this process have been in place for
about a half year, in the form of two advisory committees that provide
guidance on technical issues and policy issues confronting the Dublin Core.
One of the first assignments of these committees has been to prepare a
formal process document, and I am pleased to report that an initial draft of
that document has been produced and will be refined and presented to the
community over the coming weeks.

There are many models of goverance to choose from.  The subcommittee working
on this process will identify features from various models that most closely
match the culture of open consensus development that has become a hallmark
of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.  The process that emerges will
reflect the multi-disciplinary and international characteristics of the
Dublin Core which are at the heart of our progress thus far.

II. Polishing the Finnish finish 

RFC 2413 publically defines the semantics of DC that have been largely
stable since December of 1996.  We can think of this as DC 1.0.  Deployment
of  DC 1.0 semantics has made clear that minor changes in the definitions
are necessary to clarify the intended semantics and to reduce ambiguity
concerning their application. A review of the existing definitions will be
undertaken and small changes made as judged necessary.  The fundamental
underlying semantics will not be changed, nor will the number of elements.
One of the operational criteria for these changes is that existing
applications should require no changes as a result of these clarifications
of the definitions.  Rather, these changes should support greater
consistency across applications, and should make the semantics clearer to
new implementors.  It is anticipated that these changes will be incorporated
in a revised document that can be thought of as DC 1.1.

III. Ratifying DC Qualifier Semantics

Few if any current DC applications have been implemented without recourse to
some form of qualifiers.  We may not all agree how much qualification is
required, but pretty much everyone agrees that some is necessary. The Data
Model Working Group met in the two days following DC-6 and completed the
majority of its agenda, providing a sound  foundation for expression of
Dublin Core qualifiers.  

Clarification of qualifier semantics is critical to promoting
interoperability.  Between now and the next Dublin Core Workshop
(Tentatively scheduled for late October, 1999, in Germany), working groups
will be tasked to review qualifier semantics identified following the
Helsinki Workshop (DC-5) and reconcile these semantics with the Data Model
so that they may be expressed as consistently as possible in any given
syntax.

A parallel effort will be undertaken by these working groups to gather from
implementors additional examples of qualifiers judged to be useful and to
consolidate such semantics in proposals that will be evaluated and ratified
according to formal processes that will by then be in place.  Implementors,
this is your advance warning that such requests-for-input will be made, as
soon as the appropriate working groups are formed and populated.

IV. DC 2.0

The controversial Agent Proposal, released to the community only days before
the DC-6 meeting, sparked considerable debate on the list and at DC-6, and
raised related questions (for example, the wide recognition that Source is
just a variety of Relation).
These issues emerged roughly simultaneously in the data modelling process
and, importantly, from the efforts of independent groups of implementors and
educators trying to teach resource description using the Dublin Core.  In
the early days of the DC initiative, when we were thinking of DC primarily
as a set of semantic labels, these structural mismatches were not
particularly troublesome.  As we have grown more sophisticated in our
thinking, and as more communities have examined the Dublin Core for their
own use, the importance of a sound underlying structure has become evident.
Reconciling the needs of museums and libraries, for example, has raised many
difficulties that are best solved by sound data modelling.

Recent dialog with what I will loosely describe as the rights-management
community has amplified the importance of such models.  This community is
represented in the INDECS project, an EU-funded project to reconcile the
functional metadata requirements of several well established content
communities (including the DOI Initiative).  Those of you who read Godfrey
Rust's criticisms of the Dublin Core in last July's DLib magazine will be
pleased to know that Godfrey and his colleagues made valuable contributions
to DC-6, and further, that our preliminary discussions leave both groups
(INDECS/DOI and DC) strongly optimistic that the underlying data models of
the two efforts can be reconciled.   This reconciliation will benefit both
communities.  I have for some time now been using the notion of the Internet
Commons as a metaphor for the importance of the DC community's
cross-disciplinary focus.  This development is the strongest example thus
far of the importance of such cooperation.

A working group has been formed to carry forward this effort jointly.  The
expected result of such efforts will be a proposal for restructuring the
Dublin Core and might be thought of as Dublin Core 2.0.  It will be largely
backward compatible with DC 1.x.  It will probabaly have fewer top level
elements.  It will depend on formal qualifiers for refining the semantics of
the top level elements. It will have an underlying data model that will be
accomodate the changes in the electronic environment that cause tension in a
resource description model based in traditional bibliography.  

DC 2.0 will provide an evolutionary path for Dublin Core.  The great
majority of work on qualifier semantics will find a natural home there.  It
will not isolate DC 1.x applications, anymore than HTML 4.0 has isolated
HTML 1.0.  It will provide a development path that gives the Dublin Core
room to grow with our own increasing sophistication about metadata.  

I personally came away from DC-6 with a good deal of optimism about our path
forward.  Each of previous workshops was marked by controversy that sparked
important steps forward.  DC-6 was no exception.  The major schism in this
meeting lay between those who want stability for what we have done thus far
and those who are reaching for the next level.  It is essential that BOTH of
these objectives be met.  Fortunately, the great majority of the supporting
tasks for the two objectives lie on a common path.  I look forward to
working with all of you to accomplish them.

Nach Frankfurt im Oktober, 1999!

Dear all,

As I write the article for D-Lib Magazine, I find myself uncertain as
to what we should call versions of Dublin Core in multiple languages.
We have been calling them "versions," but as someone recently asked,
would DC-Finnish 1.1 then be a version of a version?

One alternative is "expression", as in the progression from work to
expression to manifestation.  I like this idea, but somehow it doesn't
seem to work.  It makes sense to talk about "the Dublin Core expressed
in Indonesian," but does it also make sense to talk about "creating an
expression of Dublin Core in Indonesian"?

Another alternative is, of course, "translation".  But as we have
discussed in meetings, "translation" seems kind of mechanical and one-way,
whereas creativity is required to ensure that the element definitions
"make sense" to a target audience and correctly convey the intended
semantics.  On the other hand, we do recognize that "translations"
of complex or literary works can be works of art in their own right.

Please let me know what you think -- preferably soon!

Tom

This cannot be a problem that we alone have faced...?

I do not think it wise to create new terminology where existing terminology
suffices.  Translation is, I believe, the right sense of what we are
promoting, even if there may be nuances that are different.

I am wondering if uncertainty about this is in anyway reflecting some
discomfiture about declaring one representation of DC (the english
expression) the standard representation?

I am still of the opinion that we need to do this... not because english is
in any way a better medium of expression, but rather that we need one
foundation representation that others are based on. Put another way... would
our advice to, say, the Indonesian translator of DC be to translate DC from
the Thai version, or the English version?

I think we would always recommend translating from the English version, even
though the resource description conventions of Indonesia might be in some
cultural way closer to those of Thailand than to the UK or the US or
Australia (A completely fabricated assumption, only for purposes of
example).

Subject: "Versions" of DC?


Dear all,

As I write the article for D-Lib Magazine, I find myself uncertain as
to what we should call versions of Dublin Core in multiple languages.
We have been calling them "versions," but as someone recently asked,
would DC-Finnish 1.1 then be a version of a version?

One alternative is "expression", as in the progression from work to
expression to manifestation.  I like this idea, but somehow it doesn't
seem to work.  It makes sense to talk about "the Dublin Core expressed
in Indonesian," but does it also make sense to talk about "creating an
expression of Dublin Core in Indonesian"?

Another alternative is, of course, "translation".  But as we have
discussed in meetings, "translation" seems kind of mechanical and one-way,
whereas creativity is required to ensure that the element definitions
"make sense" to a target audience and correctly convey the intended
semantics.  On the other hand, we do recognize that "translations"
of complex or literary works can be works of art in their own right.

Please let me know what you think -- preferably soon!

Tom

Dear Tom,

We have been using the term "versions" for different, but sequentially
developing versions of the English Dublin Core. I don't think we should
complicate matters by using "version" also for the non-English expressions
of the English definitions of the Dublin Core Elements etc. "Translation"
seems to be more appropriate, as for the most part, the multiple language
texts would be translations or close-to translated expressions of the
English text. If we kept to using "version" only for the sequential
development of the English Dublin Core, then it would be easier to indicate
the version number of the text used as the basis for the translation.
(Otherwise there might be some confusion as to which version was being
referred to). I am not sure if  "expression" would be very good as it
leaves alot open.

I would like to endorse Tom's remarks and add a couple of my own.  One of
the greatest assets of the Dublin Core initiative is that multilinguality is
a fundamental dimension of the work.  It is something I highlight in every
talk I give on DC, and it is an essential dimension of the progress that DC
has made towards being the foundation content description standard for the
Internet.  

It is with great pride that I point to the 20 translations of the Dublin
Core, and was very satisfying to see the authors of half of them at DC-6.  I
thank you all for the contributions you have made.  I believe you are making
a contribution not only to the Dublin Core Initiative, but to the
international richness of the Internet community as well.

I also want to recognize the special part that Tom has played in this... he
has been a major driving force in focussing effort on this problem, and the
DC initiative is the better for it.

regards,

stu

Subject: DC6 and beyond


Dear members of the dc-international list,

As many of you have read on meta2, DC6 was a momentous workshop for
Dublin Core.  For those of you who do not subscribe to meta2, I have
attached Stu's excellent summary below.  Some news:

1. My report on the activities of the Working Group on DC in
Multiple Languages was well-received and -- exceptionally for DC6 --
uncontroversial.

2. At AIT, we have finished a prototype distributed registry with versions
of Dublin Core in many languages formatted in RDF.  Before putting this
online over the coming weeks, we will be in touch with many of you about
URIs for these files on your Web sites.

3. The Dublin Core Initiative is adopting more formal procedures for
reporting and archiving the activities of its working groups.  The Web
page I maintain at the URL below has "half-migrated" to OCLC, but we still
need to work out a procedure for handling the work-flow through email.
I realize that some documents are out of sync and will give this my full
attention after December 15.

4. Most pressingly (for me), I am writing an article on Dublin Core
in Multiple Languages for the December 15 issue of D-Lib Magazine and
have been in touch with many of you this past week requesting related
information and URLs.  I will send you all some mail soon asking for
your advice and comments on aspects of the draft.

The Dublin Core community clearly sees our work as important, and a
number of us are strongly committed to moving forward on the agenda we
have described in our position paper.  I look forward over the coming
weeks to reopening discussion of the position paper in light of the
developments that that began in Washington.

Best regards,
Tom

Subject: Summary of the Dublin Core workplan for the coming year
Date: Thu, 12 Nov 1998 09:19:53 -0500

The following outline summarizes the program of work the DC Community has
ahead of it for the coming year. A more detailed treatment will be reflected
in the DC-6 Workshop Report.  

I. DC Process

Establishing a formal process for maintenance and evolution of the Dublin
Core is a central requirement for continued progress.  The Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative needs a coherent process that makes it clear how we do
our work, how change is initiated and ratified (or not), and a clear record
of that change.   The beginnings of this process have been in place for
about a half year, in the form of two advisory committees that provide
guidance on technical issues and policy issues confronting the Dublin Core.
One of the first assignments of these committees has been to prepare a
formal process document, and I am pleased to report that an initial draft of
that document has been produced and will be refined and presented to the
community over the coming weeks.

There are many models of goverance to choose from.  The subcommittee working
on this process will identify features from various models that most closely
match the culture of open consensus development that has become a hallmark
of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.  The process that emerges will
reflect the multi-disciplinary and international characteristics of the
Dublin Core which are at the heart of our progress thus far.

II. Polishing the Finnish finish 

RFC 2413 publically defines the semantics of DC that have been largely
stable since December of 1996.  We can think of this as DC 1.0.  Deployment
of  DC 1.0 semantics has made clear that minor changes in the definitions
are necessary to clarify the intended semantics and to reduce ambiguity
concerning their application. A review of the existing definitions will be
undertaken and small changes made as judged necessary.  The fundamental
underlying semantics will not be changed, nor will the number of elements.
One of the operational criteria for these changes is that existing
applications should require no changes as a result of these clarifications
of the definitions.  Rather, these changes should support greater
consistency across applications, and should make the semantics clearer to
new implementors.  It is anticipated that these changes will be incorporated
in a revised document that can be thought of as DC 1.1.

III. Ratifying DC Qualifier Semantics

Few if any current DC applications have been implemented without recourse to
some form of qualifiers.  We may not all agree how much qualification is
required, but pretty much everyone agrees that some is necessary. The Data
Model Working Group met in the two days following DC-6 and completed the
majority of its agenda, providing a sound  foundation for expression of
Dublin Core qualifiers.  

Clarification of qualifier semantics is critical to promoting
interoperability.  Between now and the next Dublin Core Workshop
(Tentatively scheduled for late October, 1999, in Germany), working groups
will be tasked to review qualifier semantics identified following the
Helsinki Workshop (DC-5) and reconcile these semantics with the Data Model
so that they may be expressed as consistently as possible in any given
syntax.

A parallel effort will be undertaken by these working groups to gather from
implementors additional examples of qualifiers judged to be useful and to
consolidate such semantics in proposals that will be evaluated and ratified
according to formal processes that will by then be in place.  Implementors,
this is your advance warning that such requests-for-input will be made, as
soon as the appropriate working groups are formed and populated.

IV. DC 2.0

The controversial Agent Proposal, released to the community only days before
the DC-6 meeting, sparked considerable debate on the list and at DC-6, and
raised related questions (for example, the wide recognition that Source is
just a variety of Relation).
These issues emerged roughly simultaneously in the data modelling process
and, importantly, from the efforts of independent groups of implementors and
educators trying to teach resource description using the Dublin Core.  In
the early days of the DC initiative, when we were thinking of DC primarily
as a set of semantic labels, these structural mismatches were not
particularly troublesome.  As we have grown more sophisticated in our
thinking, and as more communities have examined the Dublin Core for their
own use, the importance of a sound underlying structure has become evident.
Reconciling the needs of museums and libraries, for example, has raised many
difficulties that are best solved by sound data modelling.

Recent dialog with what I will loosely describe as the rights-management
community has amplified the importance of such models.  This community is
represented in the INDECS project, an EU-funded project to reconcile the
functional metadata requirements of several well established content
communities (including the DOI Initiative).  Those of you who read Godfrey
Rust's criticisms of the Dublin Core in last July's DLib magazine will be
pleased to know that Godfrey and his colleagues made valuable contributions
to DC-6, and further, that our preliminary discussions leave both groups
(INDECS/DOI and DC) strongly optimistic that the underlying data models of
the two efforts can be reconciled.   This reconciliation will benefit both
communities.  I have for some time now been using the notion of the Internet
Commons as a metaphor for the importance of the DC community's
cross-disciplinary focus.  This development is the strongest example thus
far of the importance of such cooperation.

A working group has been formed to carry forward this effort jointly.  The
expected result of such efforts will be a proposal for restructuring the
Dublin Core and might be thought of as Dublin Core 2.0.  It will be largely
backward compatible with DC 1.x.  It will probabaly have fewer top level
elements.  It will depend on formal qualifiers for refining the semantics of
the top level elements. It will have an underlying data model that will be
accomodate the changes in the electronic environment that cause tension in a
resource description model based in traditional bibliography.  

DC 2.0 will provide an evolutionary path for Dublin Core.  The great
majority of work on qualifier semantics will find a natural home there.  It
will not isolate DC 1.x applications, anymore than HTML 4.0 has isolated
HTML 1.0.  It will provide a development path that gives the Dublin Core
room to grow with our own increasing sophistication about metadata.  

I personally came away from DC-6 with a good deal of optimism about our path
forward.  Each of previous workshops was marked by controversy that sparked
important steps forward.  DC-6 was no exception.  The major schism in this
meeting lay between those who want stability for what we have done thus far
and those who are reaching for the next level.  It is essential that BOTH of
these objectives be met.  Fortunately, the great majority of the supporting
tasks for the two objectives lie on a common path.  I look forward to
working with all of you to accomplish them.

Nach Frankfurt im Oktober, 1999!

Dear all,

I have attached below a "first draft" pass at the section in the D-Lib
Magazine article about initiatives to create versions (or expressions,
or translations) in various languages.  PLEASE CHECK THE SENTENCE(S)
ON YOUR VERSION WITH PARTICULAR CARE and point out any errors fact or
perspective -- and fill any gaps, of course.

I have tried to say something about every version, and to do so in
a relatively uniform manner.  With one exception (Hachim), I do not
include personal names.  I try for each version to broadly characterize
the range of institutions involved.  

I try to group versions together to avoid making just a repetitive list;
feel free to comment on these clusters and on the transitions between
them.  In fact, I would be grateful for any suggestions on how to avoid
overusing words like "created".

Cheers,
Tom

<H3>DC-Multilingual</H3>

<P>Similar discussions have taken place over the past year or two
in many languages.  For example, the creation of DC-Arabic has
been coordinated by a researcher of the Bavaria Research Center
for Knowledge-Based Systems, Hachim Haddouti, with the involvement
of colleagues in Germany, Canada, Tunisia, USA, Morocco, United Arab
Emirates, and Jordan [<A HREF="#dc-arabic">DC-Arabic</A>].  In his view,
"DC-Arabic constitues a landmark in promoting metadata in the Arabic
language and Arabic computing.  Reactions from my colleagues at research
libraries, documentation centers, software firms, and publishers in
the Arabic-speaking world confirm that this standard is addressing a
recognized need."

<P>In Japan, the University of Library and Information Science in Tsukuba
has begun a large-scale digital library project based on Dublin Core
[<A HREF="#dc-japanese">DC-Japanese</A>].  A DC-Chinese in "Big5"
encoding (traditional characters) has been posted at the Department
of Library and Information Science at Fu-Jen University in [what
city?], Taiwan [<A HREF="#dc-chinese-big5">DC-Chinese (Big5)</A>].
Another DC-Chinese, in "GB" encoding (simplified characters), has been
created by a masters student at the Asian Institute of Technology [<A
HREF="#dc-chinese-gb">DC-Chinese (GB)</A>].

<P>Several Asian initiatives have involved centers for scientific
information.  DC-Korean was undertaken by researchers at the Korea
Research Information Center together with colleagues from Yonse
University, Ehwa Women's University, and Chung Ang University [<A
HREF="#dc-korean">DC-Korean</A>].  In Thailand, a translation was
prepared at the Technical Information Access Center of the National
Science and Technology Development Agency in consultation with colleagues
from the Thai Library Association and the Asian Institute of Technology
[<A HREF="#dc-thai">DC-Thai</A>].  DC-Indonesian, discussed above, was
approved by members of the National Library of Indonesia, the University
of Indonesia, the Center for Scientific Documentation and Information
of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, and the Library Development
Coordination Unit of the Directorate General of Higher Education [<A
HREF="#bagus">Prabawa 1998</A>].

<P>In Southern Europe, work on Dublin Core has often begun on the
initiative of government research institutions.  DC-Italian was created at
the Institute for Information Processing of the National Research Council
and passed on to the Central Institute for the Union Catalog of Italian
Libraries (ICCU) [<A HREF="#dc-italian">DC-Italian</A>].  A DC-Spanish
has been posted by RedIRIS, an academic network under Spain's Scientific
Research Council [<A HREF="#dc-spanish">DC-Spanish</A>].  DC-French was
created at the National Institute for Research in Computer Science
and Control (INRIA) [<A HREF="#dc-french">DC-French</A>].  DC-Greek is
an initiative of the Foundation for Research and Technology -- Hellas
(FORTH) in Heraklion, Crete [<A HREF="#dc-greek">DC-Greek</A>].

<P>Dublin Core has been adopted in several countries for creating
national repositories or directories of online resources.  The National
Library of Portugal is using Dublin Core in initiatives related to
the legal deposit and preservation of Portuguese publications online,
developing simple tools for metadata creation, and promoting the
standardization of Dublin Core subelements for the Portuguese context
[<A HREF="#dc-portuguese">DC-Portuguese</A>].

<P>In Denmark, a national metadata standard based on Unqualified Dublin
Core (with four added subelements under <I>Title</I> and <I>Relation</I>)
has been adoped by the Danish Library Center, Danish National Library
Authority, legal deposit libraries, and the Danish State Information
Service.  State officials must publish all their public documents
online and with metadata.  Since January 1998, a deposit law requires
online publishers to register their documents for storage by the Royal
Library on a legal deposit server; the same Dublin-Core-based form is
used to register online documents for possible inclusion in the national
bibliography.  To meet the requirements of these new laws, the government
is teaching metadata usage to thousands of administrators and assistants
and preparing tools and guidelines to help webmasters and publishers
create metadata as an integral part of their workflow.

<P>Following the Danish example, the government of Finland
has begun projects to institute legal deposit, archive online
publications, and add Dublin Core metadata to public documents [<A
HREF="#dc-finnish">DC-Finnish</A>].  In the Nordic Metadata Project,
researchers from both countries have collaborated extensively with
colleagues in the region on the harmonization of metadata strategies.
There is a DC-Norwegian, and work is underway on DC-Icelandic and
DC-Swedish [<A HREF="#dc-norwegian">DC-Norwegian</A>].  Koninklijke
Bibliotheek, the national library of the Netherlands, has created
DC-Dutch in a project for a Directory of Netherlands Online Resources
[<A HREF="#dc-dutch">DC-Dutch</A>].

<P>Finally, over thirty projects use Dublin Core in Germany, the biggest
of which involve Germany's scientific professional societies (often
in collaboration with partner societies abroad), Humboldt University,

Tom,
I understand your problem with "translation" as perhaps implying a 1-1
equivalence.
If "version" really poses a problem, you could consider "rendering" as a
semantically more viable alternative than "translation" (although
syntactically as a noun it is a little more awkward). DC-Finnish 1.1 would
be a version of the Finnish rendering of DC.
Stuart is right; all translations or "renderings" MUST be from DC in
English. Just as has been done in EuroWordNet, we can establish a Dublin
Core InterLanguage (which has been based on DC in English) but which has
its own status as the core of the multiple language DC. All local language
versions must map to the DC InterLanguage. In the future, there might even
be different "renderings" of this in different English dialects to eflect
local realities. e.g. British English, Australian English, etc.

Regards,

Carol

CHANGE OF TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS WITHIN ITALY:
From 19 June 1998 all phone and fax numbers within Italy have changed:
the city code must always begin with a 0 (and must be used even for local calls)
i.e., my phone number from +39 50 593429
becomes +39 050 593429
For six months both old and new numbers will function - in six months time
only the new numbers will function.

I'd stick with the term "version".  First, it's natural to say
"the Spanish language version".  Second, it's generally accepted
that a version "B" may differ from a given work "A" on a number
of different dimensions, such as

  - Chronology (eg, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd drafts)
  - Emphasis (eg, Advanced users, Beginning users, Librarians)
  - Platform (eg, Linux, Solaris, Macintosh, Windows)
  - Language (eg, Spanish, Tagalog, Arabic)

Not to say that designating version dimensions isn't messy.  Version
C2E1PMLA might have to be the compact way to say "the 2nd draft of
the advanced guide for Macintosh users in Arabic".

Maybe synonyms such as "release" or "step" help, as in "the Arabic
Version of DC-1.1", where DC-1.1 is Release 1.1 of the Dublin Core,
or Dublin Core, Step 1.1.

Subject: "Versions" of DC?

Dear all,

As I write the article for D-Lib Magazine, I find myself uncertain as
to what we should call versions of Dublin Core in multiple languages.
We have been calling them "versions," but as someone recently asked,
would DC-Finnish 1.1 then be a version of a version?

One alternative is "expression", as in the progression from work to
expression to manifestation.  I like this idea, but somehow it doesn't
seem to work.  It makes sense to talk about "the Dublin Core expressed
in Indonesian," but does it also make sense to talk about "creating an
expression of Dublin Core in Indonesian"?

Another alternative is, of course, "translation".  But as we have
discussed in meetings, "translation" seems kind of mechanical and one-way,
whereas creativity is required to ensure that the element definitions
"make sense" to a target audience and correctly convey the intended
semantics.  On the other hand, we do recognize that "translations"
of complex or literary works can be works of art in their own right.

Please let me know what you think -- preferably soon!

Tom

This is just what we call "translation"!  Therefore, I suggest "Traslation".

Tom,

I think we should clarify a version/translation of what.

In my case, I've translated a reference description of DC Simple
into Japanese. The document I created, say the Japanese Reference
Description of DC Simple, is a "translation" of the Reference
Description of DC Simple. 

I believe my document coveys the same semantics expressed in the
reference description (in English) to readers, i.e. same "version"
of DC Simple. 

On the other hand, I would call my document a Japanese "version" of
DC Simple reference description, i.e., a different "version" of
the reference description.

My point is:
	DC Simple has only one version (= DC1.0).
	DC Simple has multiple versions of reference description
	expressed in multiple languages.

Is this make sense?

Best wishes,

-- Shigeo

Dear all,

Someone suggested that more of the institution names remain in the
original language, such as Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico
instead of Central Institute for the Union Catalog of Italian Libraries
(ICCU).  Please let me know your preference, both in general and
for your institutions in particular.

Tom

Yes it does make sense. I would add that there were also different versions
of the English reference description. At some point I found it hard to keep
my French translation in line with the current reference description
(document) since they were all using the same URL. I was a relief when we
decided that the translation does not need to be literal.

[local] French versions of DC (if any) would be DC schemas with specific
qualifiers, or extended elements, for specific French communauties.

This is why I am not in favor of using the word "version". It is too
confusing.

Dear Tom,
Thankyou for your work on dc-international. I am sorry I have been
rather a lurker this year and have not got involved in the work of
developing international versions -- I hope I will pick this up for
Khmer next year.
As to versions -- I agree this term should be reserved for actual
versions of the main dc standard. How about "manifestations" for the
different languages?

Dear members of the Working Group on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages,

This message is reaching you through the new mailing list,
dc-international@mailbase.ac.uk.  WELCOME!

The old mailing list, dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th, will soon become
obsolete.  A few members of the old list are not yet on the new,
and I will re-invite them to register.  Many of you have been annoyed
by a SPATE OF SPAM on the old mailing list in December and January.
I am told this will cease to be a problem when we have completed the
transition to the Mailbase list.

This transition will be complete when the mail archives at
http://dlforum.external.forth.gr/dcm have populated the new
archive at http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-international/.
I have reminded the administrators of the two list sites and
trust this will soon be completed.  At that time, the archive at
http://dlforum.external.forth.gr/dcm will become a mirror site for 
the Mailbase archive.

Many of you have seen the new Web page for the working group at
http://purl.org/DC/groups/languages.htm, which supersedes the page I used
to maintain at http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~tbaker/DC-Multilingual.html.

In sum:

    Old mailing list: dc-international@cs.ait.ac.th
    Old list archive: http://dlforum.external.forth.gr/dcm
    Old Web page:     http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~tbaker/DC-Multilingual.html

    New mailing list: dc-international@mailbase.ac.uk
    New list archive: http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-international/
    New Web page:     http://purl.org/DC/groups/languages.htm

As soon as these logistic problems have been worked out, I will write
with further announcements and comments.  I would like to start a more
structured discussion about the working group's position paper and about
issues that have arisen since DC6 in the context of the December article
of D-Lib Magazine and another article on Dublin Core that is due to
appear in the January issue.  I am in touch with the DC Directorate to
learn how best to manage a discussion by email using issues lists and
other proven techniques.

I have had good feedback from many of you on the article in D-Lib
Magazine (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december98/12baker.html), and am
pleased to report that there are several more versions (or translations?)
of Dublin Core on the way.

Best regards in the New Year,
Tom

Dear all,

I take the opportunity of testing the new mailing list for aslink the
following:

Is there a standard model of RDF descriptions for the DC translations.
Tom, you said you have one for the various languages at AIT, but I fear it
is using an old syntax of RDF schemas.

In any case if there is such a model, can you send it to everyone?

Cheers,
Anne-Marie

Dear members of dc-international,

A few announcements, and some questions.  Since the December article in
D-Lib Magazine (see http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december98/12baker.html),
some new activities have begun:

-- Prof. Asuman Dogac of the Middle East Technical University in Ankara,
   Turkey, has posted a Dublin Core in Turkish at
   http://www.srdc.metu.edu.tr/DublinCore.html (set your browser for
   Turkish encoding).  The METU Library is in touch with other libraries
   in Turkey for opinions and feedback.

-- Researchers at the Library and Information Centre of the Institute
   of Computer Science at the University of Brno have begun work on a
   Dublin Core in Czech in cooperation with colleagues at other Czech
   universities and libraries.  The Ministry of Environment of the Czech
   Republic has started work on a metadata clearinghouse for ministries,
   agencies, and local authorities.

-- There has been some talk of rendering Dublin Core in Ukrainian
   and Nepali.

-- Does anyone know the mailing address of -- and I hope I am spelling
   this right -- Catalin Varuara of Romania?  She attended ECDL98 in Crete
   and indicated her interest in Dublin Core, but the address I wrote down,
   cata@waic.ro, seems to be incorrect.

-- The transition from the old dc-international list to the new one at
   Mailbase is complete, although a few people who I know are interested
   have yet to sign up.  The list currently has 51 members (see below).

-- I have set aside some time this week to learn
   the Mailbase software and would like to start a systematic
   discussion of the position paper soon.  I would much appreciate
   hearing any opinions or advice from you on how this can best be
   managed.  Should I set up a structured issues list like the one
   at http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-datamodel/files/issues.html?
   Should we start discussions on all open issues simultaneously, or
   take them one at a time?

Best regards,
Tom

Dear members of the mailing list on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages,

I have been in touch with alot of you individually over the past few
weeks and believe this is a good time to re-start discussion on the list.
First, some general announcements and comments:

--  In July I will move from Bangkok back to the German National
    Research Center for Information Technology (GMD) in Sankt
    Augustin, near Bonn, where I will oversee a Dublin Core
    implementation project from the standpoint of the GMD Library.
    This will be a very supportive environment for pursuing
    some longer-term work on multilingual Dublin Core and,
    more specifically, for collaborating with this Working Group
    on implementing the concept outlined in our position paper.
    I will miss my colleagues at the Asian Institute of Technology
    and elsewhere in Asia but am already looking for ways to continue
    and build on our work from Germany.  I was at GMD before going to
    Thailand, so my older address <Thomas.Baker@gmd.de> remains valid.

--  Last year I worked with Xu Bo, a graduate student at AIT, to set up
    a prototype registry of Dublin Core in multiple languages.  It offers
    a list of Dublin Core in twelve languages, retrieves the selected
    RDF schema from (in theory) Seoul or Helsinki, and displays it on
    the browser.  If necessary, it uses the MHTML Java applet developed at
    ULIS in Japan to display fonts for languages such as Chinese or Thai.
    It is very simple, but it works, and I wanted to propose it as a
    "straw man" implementation to focus our discussion.  Unfortunately,
    Xu Bo had to return quite unexpectedly to China in March and must
    remain there.  Since I do not myself know enough Java to prepare it
    for posting on the Web, I have enlisted the help of Eric Miller and
    of Shigeo Sugimoto and his colleagues at ULIS to check the code and
    help bring this online.

There has been some uncertainty this year about the direction of Dublin
Core, and accordingly I have been uncertain about what we should be doing
in this Working Group.  However, Stu has done a good job of articulating
a direction for Dublin Core (see the April issue of D-Lib Magazine [1]).
Dublin Core Version 1.1 will not look radically different from RFC 2314
(also known as Version 1.0), though some of its definitions will be
clearer.  The Dublin Core advisory committees are defining more formal
processes of decision-making on further developments.  

In the meantime, many people in this group, in the Dublin Core community,
and from outside have told me they believe that the position this group
elaborated through meetings in 1998 remains an excellent way forward [2].

I would therefore like to propose that over the next few weeks (ie, by
30 June), we systematically revisit, update, and reaffirm -- or modify
-- the group's position paper.  The RDF examples need to be checked and
updated.  Our position on the use of English-language tokens needs to be
reconsidered in light of some implementation projects.  The creators of
several new language versions have joined this group since the position
paper was last discussed and may want to raise new issues.

In September we will have a good six or seven weeks to plan activities
for DC7.  If by then we have a "proof-of-concept" Web page that accesses
all or most of the existing language versions of Dublin Core as RDF
schemas, we should have alot to talk about in Frankfurt.

Tom

One question.  If one uses non-ASCII characters is RDF/XML, is the
entity xml:encoding the appropriate way of expressing it.  In other
words, is the following fragement valid RDF/XML?

   <dc:title>
     <rdf:Description>
      <dc:title xml:lang="de" xml:encoding="ISO-8859-1">
       Rmiche Elegien
      </dc:title>
     </rdf:Description>
    </dc:title>

If not, what would be the appropriate way of explicitly indicating
the character set encoding to use?

I am looking at the current working draft of the multilingual working
group:

    http://purl.org/DC/documents/working_drafts/wd-multilingual-current.htm

Under item "8", the following fragment of XML appear:

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="fr">
    Le nom donn  la ressource par le crateur ou l'auteur.
    </rdfs:comment>

Please note that because XML uses the UTF-8 (or UTF-16) character set
encoding as default, this fragment will be interpreted roughly  as
follows:

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="fr">
    Le nom donn? la ressource par le cr?eur ou l'auteur.
    </rdfs:comment>

(where "?" will be some Chinese or Japanse ideograph).
This is probably not what was intended.


I propose that in the draft, examples incorporating non-ASCII glyphs
without expressing them in UTF-8 need to declare their character
set encoding explicitly.  For instance, the above fragment becomes:

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="fr" xml:encoding="ISO-8859-1">
    Le nom donn  la ressource par le crateur ou l'auteur.
    </rdfs:comment>

Any comments?

Gisle,

I suspect the specification of the encoding is dependant of how rdf is
utilised.

If the rdf is imbeded in the actual document (xml) then it should inherit
the encoding of the document, whereas if the rdf is independent of the
document it is describing then
the encoding should be specified.

ideally ... the rdf should inherit the encoding of the xml document ..

in the absence of an encoding declaration ... your suggestion sounds
reasonable ...

Well, sometimes you want to embed _several_ different languages using
different character set encodings in the _same_ metadata record. 

Here is how I would catalogue a multilingual web-based game where the use
can select his or her language of choice when logging on to the site:

    <dc:title>
     <rdf:Alt>
      <rdf:li xml:lang="en">English Title</rdf:li>
      <rdf:li xml:lang="de" xml:encoding="ISO-8859-1">German title</rdf:li>
      <rdf:li xml:lang="pl" xml:encoding="ISO-8859-2">Polish title</rdf:li>
      <rdf:li xml:lang="eo" xml:encoding="ISO-8859-3">Esperanto title</rdf:li>
      <rdf:li xml:lang="i-sami-no" xml:encoding="ISO-8859-4">Lappish
title</rdf:li>
      <rdf:li xml:lang="ru" xml:encoding="ISO-8859-5">Russian title</rdf:li>
      <rdf:li xml:lang="el" xml:encoding="ISO-8859-7">Greek title</rdf:li>
     </rdf:Alt>
    </dc:title>


> in the absence of an encoding declaration ... your suggestion sounds

Fine.  I'll use it then.

Ok .. i understand your point ... i know in html you are only allowed to
have one encoding in the document .. does the same hold for xml?

personally .. if i was mixing scripts like that .. i'd use a single encoding
like the default encodings utf-8 or utf-16

does anyone know of a practical example of a parser or xml agent that can
handle multiple encodings within the same document? or are you thinking of a
case where only the appropraite language information is extracted (ie
language negotiation) and the appropriate encoding used?

i'm just trying to clarify for myself whether your example was meant for
alng based extraction or whether all languages would be displayed ? since
each scenario would place evry different constraints on the parser .. or xml
agent

Hmmm... this I must admit that I have not considered.
Thanks for raising it.

Re-reading the W3C Recommendation 10-February-1998 of the
Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 says, I find that
sec. 4.3.3 says: "Each external parsed entity in an XML
document may use a different encoding for its characters";
and "it is an error [...] for an encoding declaration to
occur other than at the beginning of an external entity".

The way I read this is that there may be one, and only
one, encoding in use for each external parsed entity.
Which means that doing as I have done so far (i.e.: putting
encoding declarations into plain parsed entities) is in fact
_not_ valid XML. Bummer.

I would welcome further clearification from anyone
who can provide an authoritative answer on this issue.

I can't honestly see why there should be such a constraint.
But I guess it is not very productive to disagree with W3C
recommendations when creating Internet applications :-( .

> personally .. if i was mixing scripts like that .. i'd use a

Of course.  But my questions here was to address learn whether
the other way of doing it was legal XML, not whether it was
possible to do it differently.

Well, currently mine can :-) (but that doesn't make it XML,
so I'll take that it out again).

My application is a web robot that cruises the web looking for XML
metadata to enter into the database that lives in the heart of our
Internet search engine.  I was just thinking about how a multilingual
web site may want to present itself to such a robot, and constructed the
example from that scenario.

Thanks for your clarification gisle,

i looked at the xml 1.0 spec myself ... and it would appear that the only
way to specify a encoding would be in the xml processing instruction :

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="big5" ?>

The best solution for you're example would be transcoding ... the robot
would collect the data , one of the datum would be the encoding of the
document being analysed ...

you use that encoding data to convert the information into another encoding
... assuming the original document ghas the encoding correctly identified
...

The Washington State Library is exploring the use of numeric tokens to
allow semantic interoperability of metadata.  We have monitored the
discussions on the dc-international listserv.  We are interested in your
reaction to our concepts.

Washington State has invested in the harvested-metatag process of
building a searchable index database. We have adopted attribute terms
from both Z39.50 and Dublin Core.  This mixed set presents a challenge
to assigning a single scheme for our metadata.  We do not wish to
establish our attribute set as a unique registered namespace.

The Washington State model has been adopted by a growing number of
states in the US.  The common issue is of interoperability.  "Will the
WAGILS attributes work with Dublin Core or other registered sets?"

Since the underlying semantic meaning of our terms is equivalent and can
be mapped to other registered sets, we looked for a way the terms could
be "internally mapped" in the metatags.  That is when we discovered the
good effort your workgroup had made using tokens.

Our concern was the mapping of terms to other languages, especially
those using other than ASCII characters.  For example, in June the
Washington State Library will be assisting the Russian Federation with
their search services and must address Cyrillic metadata.

We propose using a numerical token rather than a textual value.  Here
are some examples in HTML and XML:

<META NAME="dc.title" CONTENTS="The name of the object"  Z="4">

<?XML version "1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE report SYSTEM "report.dtd">
<report>
  <description>
     <title>The name of the object
        <Z>4</Z></title>
  </description>
  <text of the report>
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  </text of the report>
</report>


(This declaration could probably also be expressed using attributes
under each metadata element)

The registered scheme we use for the "Z" numbers is the bib-1 attribute
set.  The bib-1 scheme includes the Dublin Core set as well as a few
others.  Reference: http://www.gils.net/elements.html and
http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html.

Several vendors have expressed their interest in supporting tokens for
metadata creation (e.g., embedded HTML metatag / XML metadata), 
harvesting (e.g., spider parsing), and fielded searching (e.g., GUI
search using local terms but internally mapped to the token).  Because
the tag numbers from Z39.50 are used, it opens up possibilities of HTTP
interoperability with Z39.50 query and retrieval rules.

Obviously, much work remains before it could be operational.  Your
comments and recommendations are greatly appreciated.

Dear all,

Many thanks to Philip for opening a discussion on the use of numbers
as tokens that represent metadata elements in a language-neutral way
(see email below).  I have been looking back through old email and
meeting notes to remind myself what we have said about this in the past.
There are many dimensions to this question; where to begin?

Let me first put this into context.  The issue
in question is Point 5 of the position paper at
http://purl.org/dc/documents/working_drafts/wd-i18n-current.htm, which
currently reads:

	5. As defined in the RFC for Unqualified Dublin Core [RFC],
	Dublin Core elements consist of a descriptive name (eg, "Author
	or Creator"), a single-word label or "token" for use in encoding
	schemes (eg, "Creator"), and element definitions. The descriptive
	names and element definitions are meant to be read primarily
	by humans, the tokens primarily by machines. The tokens look
	like English words but stand for universal elements. Universal
	elements can have interchangeable names and definitions in
	multiple languages.

In other words, we felt that the machine-readable tokens for Dublin Core
metadata should be words like "Title" and "Creator".  We also considered
using numbers to represent these concepts, but we realized that using
numbers implied the creation and maintenance of a controlled list of
numbers.  Since the numbers would not be as readable as English words,
we felt that they could introduce another source of potential errors.
This was based on the assumption, now open to reconsideration, that at
least some of the metadata would be read and debugged by hand.

In projects at Washington State and with the Russian Federation, Philip
has been advocating the use of "Z numbers" that stand for the attributes
of the Bib-1 attribute set for Z39.50 (see below).  He hesitates to
recommend that his Russian colleagues, for example, mix English tokens
with Cyrillic -- e.g. using "Creator" for top-level concepts, say, and
"Fotograf" (in Cyrillic) for more specific qualifiers or elements.
(I trust Philip will correct me if this is a bad example.)  

If I understand his position correctly, Philip is recommending that words
in English or Russian be used as local tags and that universal numbers
for a global set of semantics be layered on top of (i.e., in addition to)
these local terms.  He wonders whether we might reevaluate the position
as stated above and come to a more general agreement about the use of
numbers as tokens that stand for element semantics across languages.
I believe he pictures something like a master namespace, which would
have a defined list of primary data element concepts (DECs), each with
an assigned token.  Metadata server administrators would map their local
elements to these DECs.

This touches on an issue that goes all the way back to our first
discussions at the DC4 workshop in Canberra, where we pictured that
local tokens in a local language would be paralleled by universal
global tokens: "For a Dublin Core in Thai, one would ideally like
to have a framework for defining two parallel sets of tokens for
qualifiers: a set of local tokens expressed in the Thai language
and alphabet, and a set of matching universal tokens for those
qualifiers that were shared with other Dublin Cores."  [From:
http://purl.org/DC/groups/languages/wg-language-mr-19970303.htm]

The practical position that we later developed (motivated by concerns
of readability) acknowledged, but left unsolved, the question of how
the use of English words would scale to hundreds of concepts.  We also
recognized, but did not answer, the question of how developers of schemas
customized for particular disciplinary or language communities would
retrospectively bring their local elements into alignment with a growing
set of internationally approved elements.  I very much agree with Philip
that this is a good time to reconsider the possibilities.

In a posting to dc-general on 27 April, Bernard Eversberg points out 
one problem:

>Isn't it quite curious that all those tags are formulated in natural
>language, as if to enable human readers to understand them. That's not
>the primary objective. No one is supposed to write these labels by hand

...
>And BTW: DC-Labels are not natural language. They are English. For us, this
>language is quite unnatural ;-) Numbers are neutral.

There are other multilingual systems that use numbers.  For example,
I believe the interlingual index of the EuroWordNet project uses numbers
to stand for concepts that are shared by ontologies of Italian, English,
Dutch, and Spanish (e.g. "01461581" for "tiger cat; felis tigrina").

If we were to adopt numbers, I do not believe we should try to come up
with one master namespace.  Rather, we should define multiple namespaces
for number sets, maintained by various communities for various purposes,
and specifically reference them from our metadata (as XML does for
RDF schemas).  For example, the elements of Dublin Core are in theory
maintained only by the Dublin Core community, however they have been
given numbers and semantic glosses in other systems (e.g. Z="1097"
in http://www.gils.net/elements.html); to me, the multiplication of
(in effect) canonical sources for Dublin Core semantics raises larger
issues of control and versioning.

The ultimate goal of our discussion now should be to come up with a 
clearly stated position with which we can replace Point 5 above.

Tom

P.S. I have renamed this thread "POINT 5: Tokens" to avoid confusion
as we reconsider other points of the position paper.

The tokens must:

    Be easily parsed by machines.

    Unambiguously refer to a specific concept.

    Be unambiguously and easily associated with other tokens that
    express the same concept.

Ideally, only one token is used to express a specific concept, or, at
least, there is an obvious correspondence.  But this cannot be
universally enforced, and there will always be exceptions.

Thus, the tokens must be expressed in a way that are unique,
intuitive, and unambiguous.

Tokens that have only a local concept (e.g. application specific) can
even be expressed in the local language, or in a non standard way.

In such standards, we are only interested in tokens with a universal
concept (that is they need to interoperate with other tokens,
universally, like in most applications today).  Such tokens, must be
expressed in a universal way.  This can be numbers, widely accepted
words (in this field), commonly used notation, etc.  We cannot limit
the ways that this is expressed, as long as it looks reasonable for a
world wide standard.

Hi,

The DC tokens are very useful for identifying the elements when
we are discussing them! So if (say) "7" were to replace "Creator", 
we probably on this list, and in other fora, still would be discussing 
the "Creator" element. Or would we switch to using the _name_ "Author or
creator" instead? I doubt.

So, even if tokens from a processing point of view don't need to
be "human-readable", it would be useful if they were. I'm trying to 
think of the string "Creator" as something borrowed from the English
language, but in this context not really being part of a natural
language. Just an identifier, equally dumb as "7", but with some
extra mnemonic value.

All things considered, my vote is for keeping the tokens unchanged!

To be frank, my opinion is influenced by my pragmatic acceptance of 
English as sort of a universal language for many purposes, discussing
Dublin Core being just one of them.

Ole

>From the meeting in GMD, I was insisting on expressing this the other
way: the token must be defined "in a universally accepted way".

Anyway, the real issue was to make the token description independent
from the language in use.  This is needed to achive interoperability.
This is what a standard must say.  The standard must not specify
further decisions, that are a matter of policy.

English tokens are easier to read than numeric or random ones, but
have other disadvantages: there may be misspellings, some words may
have many meanings or writings, which may be confusing to the human
user, and reasons for errors (instead of providing readability).
Also, numeric tokens may be easier and more unambiguous to derive from
specific cases of data (e.g. Z39.50 databases).
But this is not an issue we have to resolve here.
This is a policy issue.

We should just not reject a set of policies, just because we cannot
see the reasons that someone may have to use them.  We can encourage
the use of "english language tokens", explaining the reasons, but we
should not try to enforce this, as this gives no technological
benefit.

Another advantage: there's no trouble with case-sensitivity like with
XML.

I agree with Ole's position.

I think the initial issue arisen by Philip was not the one of renaming DC
tokens but rather a way of mapping with other token (numeric tokens) in
other schemas.

<META NAME="dc.title" CONTENTS="The name of the object"  Z="4">

<?XML version "1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE report SYSTEM "report.dtd">
<report>
  <description>
     <title>The name of the object
        <Z>4</Z></title>
  </description>
  <text of the report>
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  </text of the report>
</report>

 I desagree with this syntax which makes very unclear the difference
between   metatag and metadata values: the mapping between "title" and "4"
should not be intermixed with the actual metadata. 
The mapping should be described in a local DC schema description
(RDF-schema). We need to invent a syntax for token mapping, in the
RDF-schemas description for DC.

The issue of local tokens parallelled by universal global tokens has been
more or less solved (I think) by adding a label NAME in the RDF schema
definition.
This mechanism should be extended for mapping into token numbers. 
I am not sure what "qualifiers" refer to in the above quotation: are they
DC qualifiers?
Mapping DC qualifiers names between local and global schemas has not been
properly addressed yet, but it definitively goes beyond DC 1.0.

All good ideas on tokens.  May I pose a related question?

If we have come full circle on tokens back to declaring its schema, then
I feel we have lost an opportunity.  My hope was that we could allow
local element naming (namespace authority) but agree to declare 'core'
tokens using one, assumed, worldwide, registered attribute (concept)
set.  My suggestion was to use Z39.50 (bib-1).

As long as we allow multiple token namespaces, perhaps we should abandon
the goal of a universal equivalent scheme.  Is there a way to achieve a
common token set without using qualifiers such as "Schema"?

Thank you.

If the group would allow one more message on tokens...

The Washington State Library is using a harvesting technique to extract
metadata.  Our server robots visit Internet sites, pursue links, and
read/parse document information.  If metadata is present (e.g., HTML
metatags or XML/RDF descriptions) the robot will also index these values
against our preset element schema.

It would be best if the robot did not have to refer to an external map
('Schema') to convert document metadata elements to our index terms.  We
would like the document to carry both local terms and universal tokens
value within its metadata.

This is why we are promoting 'internally mapped' metadata elements.

We are very interested in a solution that places the token with the
metadata content (without reference to external schema or tables) for
efficiency of robot extraction.  

Are changes needed to HTML / XML standards to support a well-formed
syntax that includes the absolute token value in the metadata itself?

Thank you for your assistance.

Dear all,

The Data Model working group has published "Guidance on expressing
the Dublin Core within the Resource Description Framework" (see
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/resources/dc/datamodel/WD-dc-rdf/).
We can use this now to revise the technical bits of the position paper.

Our upcoming move from Bangkok has demanded my attention this week, and I
leave this evening for a week in Germany.  I have been thinking about the
token discussion alot, however, and thank everyone who has contributed.
I will post a summary and some further thoughts as soon as I can.

Many thanks,
Tom

Hello,

Does anyone have any additional information regarding the Center for NGO
(Non-Governmental Organization) Digital Library work in Moscow? The home
page for this center is http://ngo.org.ru/ngoss/. The RDF schema of
qualified Dublin Core http://ngo.org.ru/ngoss/TR/WD-ngoss-rdf.xml for
describing resources looks very interesting!  

Does anyone have any additional information on this organization and/or
suggestions on how this design might fit in with the current DC multilingual
thinking?

eric (wishing he could read Russian)

I just found out a few days ago about http://www.rsl.ru/dc -- another
Dublin Core page in Russian -- though none of the encodings on my version
of my Netscape Communicator 4.04 for Linux seemed to work to get it
to display (I do read some Russian).  Nor could I detect an email
address on the page.  All I know is that the author of this page is
Misha Shwartzmann.

Does anyone know anything more about this?

Tom

I don't know anything about the latter, but the former work was
mentioned briefly in a post by its creator on the RDF Developer's list,
RDF-DEV. 

	http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/rdf-dev/1999-04/0011.html

More info on RDF-DEV at http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/rdf-dev/

He didn't get any replies; would be great if anyone getting in touch
copied the list if appropriate (if it bounces for non-members I'd be
happy to pass msgs on to RDF-DEV)


cheers,

Dan

Good morning, community!
I`m  Olga Barysheva from Systems Department of the National Library of
Russia  in St.-Petersburg. I try to make clear something about Russian
DC versions you find out.
The  ngo.org.ru  version is the first independent elaboration of DC in
our  country  and  also  the  first  RDF  XML-encoded  one because the
extendible  Markup  Language unfortunately is yet not so popular as it
(I  hope) must be. We are still need a good book of XML in Russian and
some guides in RDF, I think. I also find that ngo.org.ru RDF schema is
very  useful  and  detailed  but  what  we  really need for start such
projects is to create a good template for those who know nothing (about
RDFs, XMLs, DCs :)
The  www.rsl.ru  (Russian State Library, Moscow) DC  is  the  only
translation   (nothing   added) from purl.org. It is not a good one in
comparison  with the original OCLC and the other English versions. The
library  situation  in  our  country  is  difficult because of the two
national  libraries  and  the  Book Chamber. Each organization want to
play  the  leading  role in cataloguing processes. Now it is a time of
decision  making  for  choosing  a  preferable  way of operating with
Internet  resources  -  whether it will be DC based on HTML or RUSMARC
application. Unfortunately the practice of META adding in HTML is also
poor  until it will be accept as a national standard or recommendation.
In  our  Library  we  also  only research the problem because we start
digitization  process  of  our  documents as a part of the "Meeting of
Frontiers"  project  with  the  Library  of  Congress.  That`s  why  we
interested  specially  in  schemas  for  "semantic  poor" objects like
maps, photos, pictures etc. and for the collections as a whole.
That  is  why  we`ll try to understand how to build in description the
notes  on digitization technology used, compression scheme, formats of
files storage and delivery.

Best regards,
 Olga                            mailto:edd@nlr.ru

Dear all,

Did anyone archive an earlier version of the English Reference Description
of DC? 
The version I am looking for is the one that some of us have been using for
making our native language translation (at least Spanish, Greek, French).
At the time I translated it was dated as the 02/11/1997 version, although
the current official version is older (!). This version can easily be
recognised as it has a small table that classifies the DC elements in three
groups.
As the URL was exactly the same as the current one, it is very confusing.
This is an issue I had arosen at one DC-International WG meeting, asking
for versions of the English DC reference.

Dan Matei who is currently writing a Rouman translation pointed out that my
French translation does not seem to correspond the  current official
version. Hopefully we decided that the translations do not need to be literal.

If someone has a a copy of the old version, please send it to me. I would
like to make a reference to the text I actually translated.
Thanks in advance,

Anne-Marie

Dear folks in DC-International,

this may be only half of the answer to the question DC/RDF, but I think a
valuable source:

There has just been a digital libraries workshop in Moscow, supported by
the Russian Institute for Information and the British Council.

See


http://www.iis.ru/rbdlw99/index.en.html

and short report on this in LT World from Robin Yeates


http://www.sbu.ac.uk/litc/lt/1999/news1532.html

Yuri Hohlov, director of the Institute, was prime organizer, and is
well-known for his work on digital libraries thusfar in Russia. He is in
the IFLA Standing Committee on Information Technology and he and others
(including myself) have tried to start on a information resource concerning
digital library research around the world. Yuri is also responsible for
initiating several bilateral collaboration projects with the US and Great
Britain. 

Misha Schwartzmann seems to be the one in Russia (from my contacts there
from the EU) most interested in the Dublin Core. I have sent Stu a short
overview of his work recently and can forward it to this list if desired.

Hope that helps a bit - I suspect it would be very useful if both these
persons were invited to the DC 7, as Russia has certainly been
underrepresented in the past.

Best regards,
Diann

=========================================
Going on Holiday?
=========================================
 
If you leave your work for an extended period over summer, and receive a
lot of email messages, your mailbox may fill up, and your email could stop
working.
 
So before you go away you may wish to temporarily SUSPEND messages from
your Mailbase lists by sending this message to mailbase@mailbase.ac.uk
 
        suspend mail all
        stop
 
On your return, you can RESUME mail by sending this message to
mailbase@mailbase.ac.uk
 
        resume mail all
        stop
 
For more information, see:
        http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/docs/user-suspend.html

Remember, you can use the web archives to catch up on any messages you may
have missed. Alternatively you can retrieve old email archives by email.
 
=========================================
Vacation Mailers
=========================================
 
Some people use a 'vacation mailer' which sends out an automatic reply to
all incoming mail.
 
Although a correctly configured vacation mailer should never send a
message to a discussion list, nor should it send more than one message to
the same address, we have had problems in the past where lists have been
flooded by these automatic messages.
 
So, if you are going to use a vacation mailer, PLEASE SUSPEND MAIL from
all Mailbase lists before you go on holiday.
 
=========================================
Leaving the list
=========================================
 
If you want to leave this list, please send a message to:
 
        mailbase@mailbase.ac.uk
 
with this text in the body of the message
 
        leave LISTNAME
        stop
 
=========================================
If the commands don't work
=========================================
 
If the SUSPEND or LEAVE command don't work, or you get an error message,
please contact the list owner by sending a message to:

Multi-lingual schemas were an important design goal when I commenced to
write a general purpose metadata editor for DSTC (this eventually became
Reggie).

My design goals for a multilingual schema were:

1)	Metadata should be presented in the language of the viewer
	irrespective of the language of the schema. For example, if I
	create a Dublin Core instance using the French schema, a German
	viewer should see the descriptive information in German.

2)	You should be able to create new translations *without*
	modifying the original schema. Otherwise someone has to
	continually modify the default schema as new translations are
	created; a maintenance nightmare.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to come up with a clean solution that
satisfies both solutions.

My preferred approach is your Approach 1 (i.e. separate files for each
locale with a locale switch file). Separate files were implemented
both in Reggie and PrismEd (a side effect of having configurable
schemas!), but I never got around to implementing the locale switch
file. Note that for Approach 1 to work, the URL in a namespace
definition must point to the switch file, not to a locale. For
robustness, each locale should also point to a locale switch file so
that if an editor is pointed to a locale file (by mistake) it can
recover.

In other words the locale switch file would have...
<RDF:Description ID="DCSelection">
  <XXX:LocaleOption>
    <RDF:Description>
      <XXX:Locale>fr</XXX:Locale>
      <XXX:DefFile>elements_fr.rdf</XXX:DefFile>
    </RDF:Description>
  </XXX:LocaleOption>
  (etc)

and the french schema would have...

<RDF:Description ID="SchemaInfo">
  <XXX:LocaleSwitch><blah>/DublinCore/SwitchFile.rdf</XXX:LocaleSwitch>
  <XXX:ThisLocale>fr</XXX:ThisLocale>
</RDF:Description>
(etc)

You claim of Approach 2 (i.e. mixing the locales together in one file)
> The data (i.e. schema) is easier to manage, because you don't have to
> worry about putting it in separate files.  It could be stored in a
> database.

I disagree; I believe that Approach 2 makes it *harder* to manage the
various locale information because only *one* organisation is able to
manage the schema information. That one organisation has to manage
everything: from the default schema to the Ethopian Dublin Core schema.
Approach 1 allows the management to be decentralised.

For completeness, you also need to specify what schema properties can be
expressed in different languages. In Reggie and PrismEd there are two
"HCI" properties:
*	Label. This is a short (often one word) description intended
	to label buttons etc.
*	Description. This is a longer textual description intended for
	'help' screens. This text was marked up in HTML and was pointed
	to by a URL from the schema.

So in the English DC schema you have a file which contains...

	dublinCore attribute
        	description <http://(etc)/English/schema.html>
        	label 'Dublin Core'
        	container attribute set of
                	title, creator, subject, description, publisher,
                	contributors, date, type, format, source,
                	language, relation, coverage, rights

	title attribute
		description <http://(etc)/English/title.html>
		label 'Title'
		string string

and in the French DC schema you have a file which contains...

	dublinCore attribute
        	description <http://(etc)/French/schema.html>
        	label 'Dublin Core'
        	container attribute set of
                	title, creator, subject, description, publisher,
                	contributors, date, type, format, source,
                	language, relation, coverage, rights

	title attribute
		description <http://(etc)/French/title.html>
		label 'Titre'
		syntax string

also on the first and only entry on the January archive at
http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A1=ind9801&L=dc-international

Of course I do not know if there are any missing messages -- it is
not easy to analyse this as the messages in your file do not seem to
be in chronological order.

Harry, Lance,

I have attached an MBOX file of early traffic on the dc-international
list -- both on the temporary one hosted at AIT in Thailand and the 
new Mailbase list.  Please add these to the archive and let me know the
URL.  Also, please let me know if there are any gaps between the end of
this archive and the beginning of dc-international postings that are 
already archived at http://dublincore.org.  I remember alerting Paul
Miller that Mailbase had deleted some early mail, and I vaguely recall
that he tried or maybe actually did succeed in recuperating some of
those early archives.  It is possible that these attached postings are
the ones he sent.  At any rate, if there are gaps, I could go back and
check this - but will not unless I know there is a gap...

Thanks,
Tom

I see that everything in my attached MBOX file (including
postings to the AIT-based predecessor of dc-international,
though JISCMAIL does not display that address) is already
in http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/DC-INTERNATIONAL.html --
so I must have seeded the Mailbase archive with the AIT
materials already a few years ago...

Okay, looks like this is "done" and I can cross it off
my list.

I thought of this now because I thought DCMI was starting
to redundantly archive copies of past mailing lists on the
http://dublincore.org/ Web site.  Do we not do this?  If so,
where are those files located?

Thanks,
Tom

There are some JISCMAIL archives that were linked from deactivated working
groups to replace broken links on the JISCMAIL server where archives no
longer existed.

Examples:
http://dublincore.org/groups/coverage/
http://dublincore.org/groups/format/
http://dublincore.org/groups/implementors/

Okay.  So DCMI relies on JISCMAIL to maintain the archive
of all Mailbase- and Jiscmail-based mailing lists, past
and present?  Or are there any exceptions (e.g. deactivated
working groups that had to be restored from backups, or lost
mailing lists)?

Do we have to explicitly request them to maintain those
archives, or do they have a persistence policy, or perhaps
a bilateral agreement with DCMI to maintain an archive of 
all DCMI-related things?

If such commitments are not in place, we should flag this
as an issue.

This is more or less how we work. Please be aware that all dc-* 
lists were set up, at creation, to remain archived indefinitely.

I have been trying, with Pete (and with Paul last year), to 
clarify this issue. The reply from JISCmail support at the
time was:

>    Once a list has been deleted access to the archives is 
>    stopped.
>    
>    We do hold the archives indefinitely for anyone wishing 
>    to obtain a copy or even reinstate the list.
>    

As it was not completely clear what triggered the deletion of a 
list, Pete asked them the question and was told:

>>  Lists are only deleted if not used over many years, ie 
>> dc-datamodel was last used in Oct 2000. 

> If such commitments are not in place, we should flag this
> as an issue.
> 

So our practical approach should probably be to request the archive 
in Zipped form for all deactivated groups, just to make sure. Will 
discuss this with Pete.

Okay.  So DCMI relies on JISCMAIL to maintain the archive
of all Mailbase- and Jiscmail-based mailing lists, past
and present?  Or are there any exceptions (e.g. deactivated
working groups that had to be restored from backups, or lost
mailing lists)?

Do we have to explicitly request them to maintain those
archives, or do they have a persistence policy, or perhaps
a bilateral agreement with DCMI to maintain an archive of 
all DCMI-related things?

If such commitments are not in place, we should flag this
as an issue.

This is one of the main issues I had in mind when I raised
the issue of "archival policy" for DCMI in Shanghai.
My understanding of the current situation is as follows:

-- I am told that all DC-* lists on JISCMAIL were set up,
   at creation, to remain archived indefinitely (but not 
   necessarily accessible).

-- According to JISCMAIL policy, lists are deleted if not
   used over many years; i.e. dc-datamodel was last used in
   October 2000.  However, JISCMAIL holds the archives 
   indefinitely "for anyone wishing to obtain a copy or even 
   reinstate the list".

-- As a general rule, once a list has been deleted, access
   to the archives is stopped.  However, it is my
   understanding that JISCMAIL can continue to provide
   access on request.  At any rate, several deactivated
   DC- lists do remain accessible on JISCMAIL, such as
   http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-schemas.html.

-- On the other hand, there are cases where links to
   deactivated working groups were broken and a substitute
   archive was set up on the DCMI Web site.  Two examples are:

       http://dublincore.org/groups/format/
       http://dublincore.org/groups/implementors/

-- Each of the two DCMI archives cited
   above includes a ZIP file of postings that is archived by
   DCMI.  The ZIP file for DC-FORMAT, for example, unpacks to:

    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06       3287  dc-format.log0002     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06       2356  dc-format.log0010     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06       2569  dc-format.log9901     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06     124608  dc-format.log9902     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06      67811  dc-format.log9903     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06       1515  dc-format.log9904     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06       8983  dc-format.log9905     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06      14928  dc-format.log9907     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06      15573  dc-format.log9908     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06      46085  dc-format.log9909     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06       9989  dc-format.log9910     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06      40757  dc-format.log9911     
    - 2000-11-21  14:56:06       8791  dc-format.log9912     

   It should be noted that the format of these files appears
   somewhat broken -- original mbox headers stripped, control
   characters inserted here and there, etc.  They cannot be
   loaded and threaded by generic, mbox-aware mail software
   (or by any mail software at all, as far as I can tell).

-- The Directorate has discussed this issue in the past,
   concluding that under the circumstances, our practical
   approach should perhaps be to request the archive in Zipped
   form for all deactivated groups.

-- In its first years, DCMI used MAILBASE, an excellent
   mailing list service that was at some point replaced by the
   less expensive JISCMAIL.  I had understood that JISCMAIL
   would continue to keep the MAILBASE archive accessible --
   and until recently it has been accessible -- but I am
   appalled now to discover that links such as

        http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-usage/2000-02/0059.html

   no longer resolve!  This is in my opinion a very serious
   issue, because the references cited in countless postings
   and working documents will no longer be accessible.  (To be
   more precise, the postings may still be accessible in some
   form because -- in my understanding -- old MAILBASE postings
   were folded into JISCMAIL at the time of transition,
   but now they would only be accessible through JISCMAIL
   browsing or queries, and there is no way to associate an
   old MAILBASE URL with a specific JISCMAIL posting).

-- I also have serious reservations about the long-term
   usability of JISCMAIL URIs such as:

       http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0106&L=dc-usage&O=D&P=8824

   I am assuming that such URIs rely on real-time database
   query resolution and are not maintained for persistence
   independently of those databases.  It bothers me that one 
   unique posting can be cited with

      http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0406&L=dc-usage&P=R5684&D=0&H=0&I=-1&O=T&T=0
      http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0406&L=dc-usage&T=0&F=&S=&P=5018

   and who knows how many other possible URIs.

DCMI is surely not the only organization or activity to have
this problem.  Given the importance of these email archives
to higher education -- and especially given the role now of
JISC in the UK affiliate of DCMI -- I should think that JISC
itself would have an interest in helping to resolve these
long-term issues.

In sum, it looks like the bits of mailing lists are being
preserved (some at JISCMAIL and some at DCMI), but access is
patchy, ad-hoc, and of dubious persistence.

Makx,

I would like to put this on the Directorate agenda as something
we should take up with the UK Affiliate (Paul in particular).

I would not want us to lose track of this text (below) but am
not sure what to do with it for now other than to note its URL:
http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0410&L=dc-ab&T=0&O=A&X=0C1B96018DE5120699&Y=thomas%2Ebaker%40bi%2Efhg%2Ede&P=1218

Perhaps this URL could be included in the ongoing Directorate 
agenda for now.

Tom

Tom,

I am not sure if we should see this in the context of the UK 
Affiliate. It is after all something that UKOLN committed to do 
long before there was talk of an Affiliate. 

Is there any reason why we could not arrange these things through
Pete, who is the intermediary between us and JISCMAIL, keeping a
somewhat lower profile?

I am not even sure JISCMAIL know they are providing this service 
to us -- I got the impression that there is a certain tension, us 
as an international initiative using a service that is intended 
for use by the UK academic community.

Although I agree that the points you raise are very important for
coherence and persistence, I am not sure how demanding we can be 
given that this is a free service. It certainly makes sense to make
our functional requirements known to JISC, as other organizations
and projects should have the same kind of issues.

Will put this on the Directorate agenda.

Makx.

JISCMAIL belongs to JISC, which part of the Affiliate, so 
my reasoning was that JISC would have a direct interest in 
helping us solve the problem.

For the long term, I do not think JISCMAIL is an ideal solution
for DCMI -- or for the UK academic community, for that matter, for
the reasons outlined.

If there ever was that problem, I can't imagine it would remain
to be a problem now that JISC is part owner of DCMI.

I actually had an interesting chat with the JISC representative
at OAI3 in Geneva, who strongly agreed that MAILBASE was
better.  They went with JISCMAIL to cut costs but did not
properly think through the longer-term issues.  Part of the
mission of JISC is to think through the longer-term issues,
and we could perhaps help them do that by (as you say) making
our functional requirements known.

Obviously, it is political, but Paul is the perfect person
to advise us on that because he used to have alot to do with
JISCMAIL and MAILBASE.

   I am assuming that such URIs rely on real-time database
   query resolution and are not maintained for persistence
   independently of those databases.  It bothers me that one
   unique posting can be cited with

 
http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0406&L=dc-usage&P=R5684
&D=0&H=0&I=-1&O=T&T=0
 
http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0406&L=dc-usage&T=0&F=&
S=&P=5018

   and who knows how many other possible URIs.

DCMI is surely not the only organization or activity to have this
problem.  Given the importance of these email archives to higher
education -- and especially given the role now of JISC in the UK
affiliate of DCMI -- I should think that JISC itself would have an
interest in helping to resolve these long-term issues.

In sum, it looks like the bits of mailing lists are being preserved
(some at JISCMAIL and some at DCMI), but access is patchy, ad-hoc, and
of dubious persistence.

Pete,

Do you happen to know who is responsible for the deactivated
Mailbase archive?  Mailbase URLs worked for a long time after
the service was rolled over to Jiscmail, and I thought their
availability was a matter of policy, but it appears now that
they no longer resolve.

AFAIK, Jiscmail had no commitment to keeping mailbase.ac.uk URLs dereferenceable.

Mailbase continues to exist as a service provided by the University of
Newcastle, quite distinct from Jiscmail provided by CCLRC. It looks to me
(anyone who has more info - please correct me if I'm wrong) as if Mailbase
continued to make their copies of the pre-Jiscmail-migration archives available
until November 2002, but then removed them. 

So from that point the mailbase.ac.uk URLs would no longer dereference to the
Mailbase-hosted archives. The migrated archives are available only via their new
Jiscmail URLs.

Dear WG chairs,

Hi... I recently took over from Paul Miller the administration of the
Jiscmail mailing lists used by DCMI WGs.

Makx has pointed out to me recently that the configuration of the WG
lists varies considerably, and has asked me to rationalise that. I've
already made a few adjustments where access settings were leaving lists
open to spam.

I'm proposing to make some changes to the configuration of the lists
supporting the following groups:

DCMI Accessibility Working Group
DCMI Agents Working Group
DCMI Architecture Working Group
DCMI Citation Working Group
DCMI Collection Description Working Group
DCMI Date Working Group
DCMI Education Working Group
DCMI Environment Working Group
DCMI Global Corporate Circle
DCMI Government Working Group
DCMI Kernel/ERC Working Group
DCMI Libraries Working Group
DCMI Localization and Internationalization Working Group
DCMI Persistent Identifier Working Group
DCMI Preservation Working Group
DCMI Registry Working Group
DCMI Standards Working Group
DCMI Tools Working Group
DCMI Type Working Group
DCMI User Documentation Working Group

1. List-ownership, notifications and error messages
===================================================
For some WG lists, I am currently the only list-owner. This means that
I'm the only person who can make alterations to the list configuration.

It also means that any messages sent to the
dc-xxxxx-request@jiscmail.ac.uk address, rather than to the list, will
be seen only by me. Now often these messages do relate only to the
mechanics of the list and I'm happy to deal with them, but often they
relate to the business of the WG and are best dealt with by WG chairs.

I'm proposing to make all current WG chairs co-list-owners of their WG
lists so that (a) they all see this email and (b) they all have the
authority to alter the list configuration.

There are a further two classes of message that need to be handled.
These are generated by the Jiscmail server.

(a) error messages (usually when the server finds that the email address
of a subscriber is unreachable, either temporarily or permanently
because e.g. they've changed job and forgotten to unsubscribe from the
list)

(b) notifications of subscription/unsubscription (every time someone
joins/leaves the list)

In an effort to make sure WG chairs do get the information they needd
but don't receive error messages they don't know how to act on, I'm
proposing to set the configurations so that
- the error messages are sent to me but _not_ to the WG chairs
- the subscription/unsubscription messages are sent both to me and to
the WG chairs

This means that WG chairs will (start to or continue to) see messages
from the Jiscmail server when people subscribe/unsubscribe from the
list, but these are informational only (except in the few cases of lists
which are intentionally closed). And you will also receive the mail sent
directly to the list-owner address. But you will not get the error
messages.

If on the other hand, you _do_ want to receive the error messages as
well, let me know and I can set that accordingly.

Similarly, if you do _not_ want to receive notifications, let me know
and I can set that accordingly.


2. Subscription/Review options
==============================
I'm proposing to change the subscription options for the above lists so
that they are all set to

Subscription=Open, Confirm

i.e. open to user subscription, subject to that user responding to a
confirmation email from the server. i.e. subscribers do _not_ require
the approval of list-owners to subscribe to a WG list.

(N.B. this is only for the WG lists above, which should be open for
people to join. Other lists are closed/controlled for whatever reason
and I'll leave that as it is.)

I'm proposing to change the review options for the above lists so that
they are all set to

Review=Private

This means that only people subscribed to the lists can obtain a list of
subscribers.

There is also a good deal of variation in whether the the server sets a
Reply-To list or Reply-To sender header. But I'm hesitant to alter those
on the basis that existing list members are probably accustomed to the
existing behaviour.

If I don't hear from you, I'll assume this is OK ;-) And I'll implement
the changes suggested above for the lists above on Wednesday 10 March
2004.

Cheers
Pete
