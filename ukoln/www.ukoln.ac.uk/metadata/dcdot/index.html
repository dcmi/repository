</a><br>
2012-11-28, DC-2013 in Lisbon will explore questions regarding the 
persistence, maintenance, and preservation of metadata and descriptive 
vocabularies. The need for stable representations and descriptions spans
 all sectors including cultural heritage and scientific data, 
eGovernment, finance and commerce. Thus, the maintenance and management 
of metadata is essential to address the long term availability of 
information of legal, cultural and economic value.  On the web, data -- 
and especially descriptive vocabularies -- can change or vanish from one
 moment to the next.  Nonetheless, the web increasingly forms the 
ecosystem for our vocabularies and our data.  DC-2013 will bring 
together in Lisbon the community of metadata scholars and practitioners 
to engage in the exchange of knowledge and best practices in developing a
 sustainable metadata ecosystem. DC-2013 will be collocated and run 
simultaneous with iPRES 2013 providing a rich environment for 
synergistic exploration of issues common to both communities.

 Webinar: Translating the library catalog from MARC into Linked Data: An
 update on the Bibliographic Framework Initiative
</a><br>
2012-11-28, A NISO/DCMI Webinar with Eric Miller will be held online at 
1:00PM Eastern Time (18:00 UTC) on 23 January 2013. Registration for 
this webinar closes 23 January 2013 at 12:00PM Eastern (17:00 UTC). In 
May 2012, the Library of Congress announced a new modeling initiative 
focused on reflecting the MARC 21 library standard as a Linked Data 
model for the Web, with an initial model to be proposed by the 
consulting company Zepheira.  The goal of the initiative is to translate
 the MARC 21 format to a Linked Data model while retaining the richness 
and benefits of existing data in the historical format. In this webinar,
 Eric Miller of Zepheira will report on progress towards this important 
goal, starting with an analysis of the translation problem and 
concluding with potential migration scenarios for a broad-based 
transition from MARC to a new bibliographic framework.  Additional

<p><a href="http://dublincore.org/news/2012/#dcmi-news-201206014-04">DCMI Metadata Terms published with RDFa markup
</a><br>
2012-06-14, A maintenance release of DCMI Metadata Terms, published 
today, now includes HTML markup describing all of its properties, 
classes, datatypes, and vocabulary encoding schemes in machine-readable 
RDF in accordance with the new W3C RDFa Lite 1.1 specification.  RDFa 
Lite 1.1, published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2012, is the 
simplest variant of RDFa, a syntax for embedding structured data in Web 
pages.  A Web page with RDFa provides -- in the same source document -- 
both the human-readable text rendered on-screen by browsers and the 
detailed machine-readable representation needed by Semantic Web 
applications.   The publication software used by DCMI for the past 
decade was modified and extended to support RDFa by Hugh Barnes, Gregg 
Kellogg, and Mitsuharu Nagamori with help from Manu Sporny, Tom Baker, 
Dan Brickley, and Jon Phipps.  All of the software and data used to 
generate this documentation is available from an open-source repository 
on GitHub.

</p>
<p><a href="http://dublincore.org/news/2012/#dcmi-news-201206014-05">DCMI Metadata Terms available in multiple formats via content negotiation
</a><br>
2012-06-14, Following the W3C guidelines "Best Practice Recipes for 
Publishing RDF Vocabularies", documentation of DCMI's metadata terms may
 now be requested by Web browsers and software applications in several 
formats.  For example, an RDF description of the DCMI property "Title" 
may be requested as a file in RDF/XML or Turtle syntax, via HTTP content
 negotiation, or as an  HTML page with an RDF representation embedded in
 its markup using RDFa.  Since March 2000, users navigating to the URI 
http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title in a Web browser have been shown a
 difficult-to-read RDF/XML schema.  Browsers will now display a 
human-readable HTML document, and most browsers will take users to the  
spot in the page where the property "Title" is defined.  DCMI's 
implementation of content negotiation was undertaken by Jon Phipps with 
assistance from Tom Baker and Jinho Park.  Interested software 
implementers are invited to inspect, comment on, contribute to, or raise
 issues about the approach taken, which is fully documented in an 
open-source repository on GitHub.

design of ontologies and controlled vocabularies useful in linked data 
on the open Web. The tutorials will also focus on design of metadata 
application profiles to meet an organization or company's needs to 
publish to the open Web using OWL and topic maps ontologies. Presenters 
Karen Coyle and Sam Oh have extensive experience teaching and working 
with professionals practicing in all forms of memory institutions 
(libraries, museums and archives) as well as the private sector. The 
tutorials are designed to address the needs of professionals with either
 minimal technical skills or those with extensive skills in non-semantic
 metadata wanting to develop knowledge and skills in the context of

</a><br>
2012-03-14, A NISO/DCMI Webinar with Dan Brickley will be held online at
 1:00PM Eastern Time (17:00 UTC) on 25 April 2012. Registration for this
 webinar closes 25 April 2012 at 12:00PM Eastern (16:00 UTC).  Dan 
Brickley will explore how the publication methods of Schema.org relate 
to the methods used to publish Linked Data. Must data providers commit 
to one or the other, or can the two approaches exist side-by-side, even 
reinforcing each other? A full description of the webinar can be found 
at http://www.niso.org/news/events/2012/dcmi/linked_data/.

</a><br>
2011-12-20, The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative's Schema.org Alignment 
Task Group held its first teleconference on 12 December to discuss a

different potential uses for published mappings: as a social signal that
 different standards can work together, as a source of documentation for
 people who work with data, as a source of patterns for search-engine 
engineers, and as input into the further development of vocabularies and
 related applications.
